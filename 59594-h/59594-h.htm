<span class="chap_name no-indent">CAPTIVATING BETTY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was as cold as Christmas, and Christmas
Eve it was. A thin crust of snow lay over
the level landscape of lower Virginia, and
the declining sun cast a lovely rose-red light
upon the silver world. Afar off lay the river
that led to the great bay, both river and bay
frozen hard and fast as steel. The crystal
air was sharp and still, and in the opaline sky
a little crescent moon smiled at the sparkling
stars. Along the broad lane that led from the
wooded heights to the spacious brick mansion
of Rosehill, seated on the river bank, a
great four-horse team trotted merrily, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>stout farm-horses snorting with delight, and
the negro driver and his helpers laughing,
and singing Christmas catches, their voices
echoing in the clear, cold air. The Rosehill
mansion itself seemed to radiate Christmas
cheer. From the warm, wide-throated chimneys
curled delicate wreaths of blue smoke,
and a venturesome peacock had climbed upon
the flat roof and stood on one leg, warming
himself comfortably against the hot chimney.
The panes of the many windows glittered in
the sinking sun, and on the frozen river a
couple of skaters flew back and forth like
birds upon the wing, their shrill little cries
and laughter resounding gaily in the crisp
cold.</p>

<p>A mile down the river lay another cheerful
homestead, not stately and wide and long,
with marble steps and a fine carriage drive,
like Rosehill, but little and low and with a
single chimney. No gorgeous peacock huddled
against its one chimney, but a family of
blue pigeons, finding the pigeon-cote chilly,
circled about the solitary chimney, and were
as merry as if they had been great splendid
peacocks instead of the humble little birds
that they were. The tall holly trees in all
their Christmas glory of red and green, on
each side of the little porch, gave the place its
name of Holly Lodge. From its windows,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>too, streamed cheerfulness, and a golden fire
sang and danced upon the broad hearth in its
one small sitting-room. But Holly Lodge
could not be otherwise than gay, because in
it dwelt Betty Beverley, the gayest young
creature alive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Holly Lodge" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, Betty had a splendid dowry; that is
to say, she had youth, health, gaiety of heart,
an indomitable spirit, and a pair of the
softest, loveliest, most misleading dark eyes
that were ever seen. Betty was the soul of
sincerity and truth, yet she was also an arrant
hypocrite and flatterer to those she loved.
Likewise, she had the heart of a lion concerning
burglars, tramps, runaway horses, and
dangers of all sorts; but when it came to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
caterpillars and daddy-long-legs, small
spiders and frightened mice, Betty was cowardly
beyond words, and shrieked and fled
at the mere sight of those harmless creatures.
Music and dancing were like foretastes of
Heaven to Betty, who could dance twenty-five
miles a night without the slightest fatigue.
But she was the same gay little Betty in the
long wintry days at Holly Lodge, with no one
for company except her grandfather, Colonel
Beverley, and his rheumatism, and Uncle
Cesar and his wife, Aunt Tulip, the two old
servants who had followed them into exile.
For Colonel Beverley was born and reared in
the great house of Rosehill, and Betty, too,
was born there, and had passed the whole of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>her short life in its stately rooms and its old
walled garden, except the last year. Evil
times had come upon Colonel Beverley, and
the piled up mortgages at last drove him
forth. The Colonel, tall and straight as an
Indian, grim to look at, but gentle at heart,
said truly that for himself he minded not
Holly Lodge, with its few cramped rooms
and its mite of a garden patch; but for little
Betty&mdash;&mdash; Here, the Colonel&rsquo;s voice would
break, and whenever this point was reached
in the discussion, Betty always rushed at the
Colonel and kissed him all over his handsome
clear-cut, pallid face, and declared that
he had insulted her by his hateful remarks,
and that she would a thousand times rather
live at Holly Lodge with him, than live at
Rosehill with millions of dollars, without him.
As Betty was very young and unsophisticated,
she really believed this, and it comforted
the Colonel&rsquo;s weary heart to hear it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>This was their first Christmas at Holly
Lodge, but as Betty said to the Colonel on
the afternoon of Christmas Eve:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granddaddy, I mean this to be the very
happiest Christmas we ever had, because we
are together, and your rheumatism is better,
and I am going to a dance every night this
week, and have a perfectly brand new white
muslin gown to wear, and goodness knows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>what will be left of it after six dances, because
I never really begin to enjoy myself until I
have torn my gown all to pieces!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Betty was saying this, she was standing,
delicately poised, on a table, putting a
wreath of laurel leaves around the portrait
of Colonel Beverley, taken in his youth, when
he was a boy officer, with his first epaulets,
his hand sternly grasping his sword. Above
the portrait hung the same sword, and Betty
was wont to decorate the hilt with a sprig of
laurel, too. The portrait was a handsome
picture, and the Colonel was secretly proud
of it. A part of Betty&rsquo;s outrageous flattery
of Colonel Beverley was that to assure the
Colonel, solemnly, that nothing would induce
her to marry until she could find a man as
handsome as he was in his youth. The Colonel,
sitting in his great chair, listened to
this for the hundredth time with the greatest
pleasure. Since that St. Martin&rsquo;s summer of
his youth, there had been a long period of
tranquil life at Rosehill. Then had come the
great tragedy of the wartime, and Colonel
Beverley had put on a gray uniform, and
ridden at the head of the regiment the county
raised, his stalwart son, Betty&rsquo;s father,
riding by his bridle.  The Colonel came back
in four years to Rosehill, but the young son
lay buried on the Bed of Honor, with a bullet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>through his brave young heart. Betty was a
dark-eyed baby girl in those days. Now, she
was a dark-eyed girl of twenty, and was all
the Colonel had left in this world. Even Rosehill
went with the rest. The back of Colonel
Beverley&rsquo;s chair was against the window
which looked toward Rosehill, for the Colonel
was sixty-eight, and could not forget wholly
the sixty-seven years when Rosehill had been
his home, and did not like to look toward the
place. To make it worse, Rosehill had been
bought by some rich Northern people, who
had wickedly and sacrilegiously, as the Colonel
considered, put a furnace in the house,
electric lights and many other modern and
devilish inventions, which harrowed the Colonel&rsquo;s
soul. So, like a wise man, he turned
his eyes away.</p>

<p>Within the plain little room were some
relics that had survived the universal wreck.
There was Betty&rsquo;s harp, to which she sang the
old-fashioned ballads the Colonel loved.
Then, there was the Beverley punch-bowl&mdash;a
great bowl of old Lowestoft porcelain, with
three medallions, representing hunting
scenes, and an inscription in faded gilt, &ldquo;For
John Beverley, Esq., of Virginia.&rdquo; It had
belonged to many John Beverleys, Esquires,
before it came to the Colonel, and was
regarded as a sort of fetich in the family.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>Betty alone had the responsibility of dusting
it, and Uncle Cesar would say solemnly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d heap ruther break my arm than break
that thur bowl.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>Beside the bowl, there was some quaint old
silver and the 1807 decanters, huge things of
pink and white cut glass, that had known good
vintages in their day. By Betty&rsquo;s harp lay
her grandfather&rsquo;s fiddle-case, for the Colonel
loved his fiddle, and he and Uncle Cesar, his
&ldquo;boy,&rdquo; fiddled seriously together, as they
had done since they were small boys together,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>sixty years before, and had got rapped over
the head with the same fiddle-bow.</p>

<p>There were a plenty of windows in the little
room, and, as muslin curtains are cheap, there
were plenty of curtains, and geraniums and
verbenas too were abundant, as they cost
nothing at all. On the walls was a pretty
paper, all roses and green leaves, pasted on
by Betty&rsquo;s own hands, with Uncle Cesar holding
the stepladder while Betty had worked,
singing while she worked. It was Betty too
who had painted the shabby woodwork white,
daubing away gaily, and laughing at her
blunders. Nevertheless, she had succeeded,
for Betty was a very efficient person. The
chimney had a wide throat and drew like a
windlass. So, on the whole, the sitting-room
at Holly Lodge was a cheerful place.</p>

<p>Betty, standing on a little table, was so
engrossed in her occupation of getting the
laurel wreath straight over the Colonel&rsquo;s
picture, that she did not hear the tramp of a
horse&rsquo;s hoofs outside, nor a knock at the front
door, nor Uncle Cesar opening it and a man&rsquo;s
tread in the little hall. In her eagerness, she
reached up very far, and although she was a
slim creature, the rickety table trembled
under her light foot, and the Colonel cried
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind, Betty, mind!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>But it was too late. The table swayed, and
Betty uttered a little shriek and came down
with a crash, not upon the floor, but in the
arms of a handsome young officer in his cap
and military cloak, who appeared to have
dropped down the chimney.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">A YOUNG SOLDIER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Colonel started up and Uncle Cesar
rushed in from the hall, followed by Aunt
Tulip from the kitchen. Betty managed to
disengage her skirts from the spurs of the
young officer, and then stood upon her feet,
utterly bewildered. The only person who
was not panic-stricken was the young officer
himself, who stood bowing, cap in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me,&rdquo; he said to Betty, and
bowing low to her and then to the Colonel.
&ldquo;Just as I was about to enter the room, I
saw that you were tottering, and ran forward
and caught you just in time. I am afraid you
would have had a bad fall, otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are perfectly excusable, sir,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>the Colonel, rising grandly. &ldquo;Your advent
was most fortunate, as, although I saw my
granddaughter&rsquo;s danger, I had not the agility,
with my years and rheumatism, to catch her
as you did. May I ask to whom I am indebted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo; said the young
officer, laying a card down on the table, &ldquo;of
the United States Army, and the son of Mr.
Fortescue of Rosehill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s quick eyes read the card as it lay
on the table. &ldquo;Lieutenant John Hope Fortescue,
United States Army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the Colonel&rsquo;s face changed a little.
He had not yet grown used to the name of
Fortescue of Rosehill. But Betty did not
mind. She saw only that Mr. Fortescue was
young and had a fine, supple figure and a
pair of laughing eyes like her own, and a
trim little black mustache and a close-cropped
black head and a very graceful manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, too, Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo; she said,
holding out her slim hand, which the young
lieutenant took. &ldquo;I think our acquaintanceship
has had a very auspicious beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Fortescue replied gallantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it saved you from a fall, I shall certainly
consider it most auspicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes
and laughed, as young creatures do who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>the sweet and subtle understanding of youth.
The Colonel then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you know my name&mdash;Colonel
Beverley&mdash;and this is my granddaughter,
Miss Elizabeth Beverley. Will you be
seated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandfather only calls me Elizabeth when
he is introducing me, or is very much vexed
with me. On all other occasions, I am Betty,&rdquo;
explained Betty gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty Beverley&mdash;what a charming
name!&rdquo; answered Fortescue, determined to
admire everything concerning this adorable
Betty.</p>

<p>Uncle Cesar took Fortescue&rsquo;s military cloak
away, and the young officer sat with his handsome
head and elegant figure outlined against
the strong light of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must beg pardon for my intrusion,&rdquo; he
said to the Colonel, &ldquo;but I have come upon
official business&mdash;hence my uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir,&rdquo; replied the Colonel.
&ldquo;I have worn both the cadet gray and the
army blue. Later, I resigned and spent some
tranquil years at Rosehill. When the irrepressible
conflict came, I put on a gray uniform,
as did my son&mdash;my only son&mdash;the
father of this young lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the Colonel indicated Betty, who
spoke quickly and with pride:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am a soldier&rsquo;s daughter and proud
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soldier should be proud of it,&rdquo;
promptly answered Fortescue, with a smile.
Betty was no Quaker maiden, but came of
fighting stock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My errand,&rdquo; continued Fortescue, turning
to the Colonel, &ldquo;is from my superior
officer, Major Studly, who is engaged in making
some military surveys in this neighborhood.
We hope to go in camp by March. I
have found an excellent place for our encampment,
with running water for the animals,
and a spring, about five miles from here, in
the rolling country. I understand that the
land is yours, and Major Studly asks your
permission to occupy it for a month or six
weeks, perhaps. Of course&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;compensation
will be made for its use by the Government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compensation be hanged!&rdquo; replied the
Colonel blandly. &ldquo;It gives me pleasure to
oblige a brother officer, although the United
States Government may go to the devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue smiled at this. From the great
fortress forty miles away, he had made various
incursions into the country, and had happened
upon many gallant old irreconcilables,
like Colonel Beverley, who felt it their duty
to hurl defiance upon the United States Government,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>although they were really among
its best citizens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you very much,&rdquo; said Fortescue,
in a manner as courtly as the Colonel&rsquo;s, &ldquo;not
only for myself, but for Major Studly. We
will do as little damage as possible. No doubt
we shall be able to buy the wood we need for
our encampment.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="468" height="200" alt="Storm" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Not from me, sir,&rdquo; promptly replied the
Colonel. &ldquo;You are welcome to all the wood
you need, and if it is too much trouble to cut
it down, burn up the fence-rails, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Beverley liked to act the grand
seigneur, but, owing to unfortunate circumstances,
he was able to be grand only in small
matters, like fence-rails.</p>

<p>During this conversation, Betty sat demurely
in her chair. At the mention of compensation,
a rosy vision passed before her
eyes of a new roof to the kitchen, and possibly
a new gown for herself. But when the Colonel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>magnanimously presented the Government of
the United States with the use of his land
and as many fence-rails as were necessary for
fires, Betty, with a lofty spirit not unlike the
Colonel&rsquo;s, dismissed the hope of repairing
the kitchen and the dream of the new gown.</p>

<p>Fortescue, however, had no intention of
confining his conversation to the Colonel,
and so, looking toward Betty, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my first visit to this county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are pleased with Rosehill,&rdquo;
replied Colonel Beverley. &ldquo;Rosehill has
sheltered seven generations of Beverleys.
The present mansion was built by my grandfather,
succeeding a smaller house built by
the first Beverley of Rosehill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admire the house very much,&rdquo; said Fortescue.
&ldquo;I am only sorry that my profession
will prevent me from spending much time
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rosehill is a noble inheritance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were upon delicate ground, but it was
impossible that the subject of Rosehill could
be avoided at their first meeting. Fortescue
congratulated himself on getting smoothly
over a difficult subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, however,&rdquo; he continued, still smiling
at Betty, &ldquo;to make frequent visits here as
long as I am stationed on this coast. I believe
both the hunting and shooting are fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;It has
been a good many years since I indulged in
either. My granddaughter, however, likes
the hunting field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Betty. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a
swell hunt club like you have at the North,
but our foxes are just as wary and our dogs
as intelligent. Day after to-morrow there is
to be the grand Christmas hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; explained Colonel Beverley,
&ldquo;is an annual custom in the county. The
gentlemen in this vicinity all assemble at daybreak
at the house of some gentleman in the
neighborhood, for at daybreak the scent lies.
The huntsmen have a hasty breakfast by
lamp-light, and start out before sunrise. The
fox is seldom caught for several hours, because
we have the red fox in this county,
which can double many times on his pursuers.
Then the victorious huntsman presents the
brush to the lady he wishes to compliment. It
is a little ceremony of great antiquity. And
then they have the hunt breakfast, with eggnog,
the flower of all seductive beverages
which bloom at Christmas time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it is possible,&rdquo; asked Fortescue
of Betty, &ldquo;that I, with three of my
brother officers, who are spending Christmas
with me, could be permitted to join in the
Christmas hunt day after to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;The huntsmen
are to meet at Bendover, the Carteret place,
and Sally Carteret is my best friend. I&rsquo;ll
ask Sally to invite you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title=""  />
</div>

<p>Although the great fortress lay only forty
miles off, and was well known by sight to
Betty Beverley and Sally Carteret and all the
other girls in the county, the dashing young
officers were not much in evidence, and Betty
secretly gloried at the idea of presenting
four of these adorable creatures at the Christmas
hunt. As for Fortescue, who knew the
world well, the frank confidence and the cordial
hospitality of these unsophisticated
country gentlepeople delighted him beyond
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="350" height="246" alt="Woods" title=""  />
</div>

<p>Then they talked awhile on what the rest
of the world was talking about, Betty listening
with all her ears, and putting in an occasional
word. Most of Fortescue&rsquo;s conversation
was addressed to the Colonel, but
his eyes were furtively fixed on Betty&rsquo;s
charming face and her little feet, with buckles
on her low shoes showing coquettishly from
the edge of her gown. Fortescue professed
an admiration and affection for Rosehill
which, it must be admitted, was very much
accentuated by Betty&rsquo;s bright eyes. Colonel
Beverley, with finely shaded sarcasm, expressed
regret that Fortescue&rsquo;s father, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>great New York banker, should not spend
more time at Rosehill, and Fortescue assumed
an apologetic attitude for his father, and was
full of regret that he himself was debarred
from being much at Rosehill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You chose the profession of a soldier,&rdquo;
said the Colonel, &ldquo;when, as I understand,
you might very well have been a well fed
drone in the hive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; replied Fortescue, laughing.
&ldquo;My father doesn&rsquo;t like drones. He is himself
a man of action and achievement, and my
two brothers have been trained to work in my
father&rsquo;s own line. But I always loved the
military profession, and have no taste nor,
indeed, capacity for any other. It is one of
the sacrifices of an army life that I can only
come to Rosehill at intervals. But wait until
I retire, thirty-six years from now. Then I
intend to settle myself at Rosehill permanently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I can&rsquo;t wait so long to welcome
you,&rdquo; said the Colonel, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&mdash;can,&rdquo; answered Betty. &ldquo;And
when you come back you will find me on the
retired list, too, still Miss Betty Beverley, of
Holly Lodge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of this Fortescue expressed the utmost disbelief.</p>

<p>Then Fortescue and Betty talked about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>gaieties of the Christmas week. There was
to be a dance every night, in addition to the
Christmas hunt. Fortescue expressed the
deepest regret that, being unknown in the
county, neither he nor his guests at Rosehill
would be likely to receive invitations, but on
this point he was reassured by Colonel
Beverley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you and
your friends arrived only yesterday. My
granddaughter told me yesterday morning
that for the first time this winter smoke was
coming out of the Rosehill chimneys. As soon
as people find out that you are in the
county, you will certainly receive invitations
to everything that is desirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue expressed a pious hope that this
might come true. Then, feeling that he had
stayed as long as he possibly could for a first
visit, Fortescue rose and shook hands with
the Colonel, who cordially invited him and his
friends to Holly Lodge. When Betty laid her
little hand in his, Fortescue said, as he gave
it a delicate pressure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Miss Sally Carteret is kind enough to
invite my friends and myself to the Christmas
hunt, may I hope that you will chaperon us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Betty; &ldquo;provided you are
not too lazy. On hunting mornings, I am in
the saddle by six o&rsquo;clock. I haven&rsquo;t a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>imposing mount. Old Whitey pulls the rockaway,
and isn&rsquo;t above hauling wood and going
to the mill, but he has a strain of Diomede
blood in him, and there&rsquo;s life in the old horse
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gave Fortescue an inspiration, but,
being a natural diplomat, he kept it to himself.</p>

<p>Uncle Cesar was waiting in the narrow little
passage with Fortescue&rsquo;s military cloak, and
brought up his horse, which had been standing
with the reins thrown over a limb of one of
the great holly trees. As Fortescue rode past
the window, sitting straight and square on
his high-bred chestnut, Betty glued her nose
to the window-pane, and, much to her embarrassment,
was seen by Fortescue, who raised
his cap, and bowed to his saddle-bow.</p>

<span class="no-indent" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</span><br />

<span class="no-indent chap_name">THROUGH A DORMER WINDOW</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Betty</span> watched Fortescue as he galloped
along the road that lay through the open fields
to Rosehill. The vision of the Christmas hunt
grew bright. She would see Sally Carteret
that night at the dance at Marrowbone, and
Sally was no more likely to deny an invitation
to four captivating young officers than
Betty herself. Betty brought her mind back
with a jerk from this new and brilliant element
which had suddenly burst into her placid
life, to the preparations for Christmas. They
were such as would be made in the small
household of a bankrupt Virginia colonel and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>his granddaughter, his &ldquo;boy&rdquo; of sixty-five
and the &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s&rdquo; wife of sixty, but they were
illuminated by the true Christmas spirit,
that sweet inspiration and good will, the
radiance of the Star of Bethlehem. By much
scheming and saving, Betty had acquired
enough money to buy for the Colonel a military
history in several volumes, for which he
had expressed a wish. Equally, with infinite
pains and secrecy, the Colonel had contrived
out of his scanty purse to buy for Betty a
little locket and chain; and there were simple
presents for Uncle Cesar and Aunt Tulip,
useful things that would make them more
comfortable. And from the two old faithful
servants were humble gifts that were highly
rated by Betty and the Colonel. Then there
were the preparations for the Christmas
dinner the next day. Although there was not
much money in the little brown house of Holly
Lodge, there were oysters a-plenty upon the
river shore, and a green turtle had been lying
on his back for a week in the cellar, to be
made into turtle soup for the Christmas
dinner, and Aunt Tulip had a dozen bronze
turkeys which kept her busy, of which the
patriarch, a noble gobbler, had gobbled his
last <i>morituri salutamus</i>. A dish of terrapin,
and a half dozen partridges, knocked over by
Uncle Cesar, who had a rusty old gun, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>monumental plum pudding, were mere adjuncts
to the feast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>It had been the Colonel&rsquo;s practice, at the
old mansion at Rosehill, to invite half the
county to his Christmas dinner. In the little
sitting-room at Holly Lodge, there was not
much room for anybody or anything except
the big furniture and the Colonel&rsquo;s fiddle-case
and Betty&rsquo;s harp; besides, the Colonel, after
his misfortune, had, as yet, not much heart
for company. He and Betty had had dozens
of invitations from all over the county and
beyond, for Christmas, but, as Betty said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>&ldquo;Granddaddy and I have always been
together at Christmas ever since I can remember,
and he has nobody but me and I have
nobody but him, and so we must stay together
on Christmas Day, Granddaddy and I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dusk came before Betty had finished
her preparations for the next day, and then
it was time to dress for the party at Marrowbone,
the Lindsay place, where there were
young students home from the University of
Virginia, and a great jollification was to be
had. The clutch of cold upon the world had
tightened as the red sun disappeared and the
stars came out in the dark blue heavens. In
Betty&rsquo;s little white bedroom, however, a
glorious wood fire was roaring, and the scent
of the odoriferous wood and the geraniums in
the window made a delicious atmosphere.
Betty stood before the fire, warming her little
feet, and saying to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I wish we could afford to have a boy
to bring up wood and pick up chips and do
so many things that Uncle Cesar has to do,
and really isn&rsquo;t able, poor old soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Betty&rsquo;s mind reverted to former
Christmases, at Rosehill, when there were
plenty of servants and plenty of everything
except money, and Betty in her ignorance
knew nothing of debts and duns and mortgages
and such unpleasant things. She looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>about her with a little air of discontent, and
thought of her beautiful big corner bedroom
at Rosehill, with its marble mantel and the
ornamental plaster frieze around the ceiling,
and the bell to ring, by which a maid always
appeared. But, being a courageous person,
Betty took herself in hand, and put an immediate
stop to painful reflections. She went
up to the little dressing table, lighted by a
candle on each side of the mirror, and, shaking
her small fist wrathfully at her reflection
in the glass, proceeded to lecture herself
severely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="300" height="340" alt="Dresser and Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Betty Beverley,&rdquo; she said sternly,
puckering her forehead, &ldquo;this sort of useless
repining is perfectly disgraceful, and has got
to stop. Do you understand, Betty? <i>It has
got to stop.</i> You have got your grandfather
and a great many comforts and blessings, and
you don&rsquo;t owe any money, and you are young
and very, very pretty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point, Betty&rsquo;s brow smoothed out,
her eyes assumed a beatific expression, and
her rosy lips came wide open, showing a
lovely, elusive dimple in her left cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no use denying it, it is a fact and a
very agreeable one, but, as Aunt Tulip says,
&lsquo;Beauty ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;; behavior&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; Your
good looks won&rsquo;t amount to anything if you
are a coward and a poltroon; and you, a soldier&rsquo;s
daughter and granddaughter, with no
more pluck than a chicken! Betty, I am
ashamed of you. Now, make up your mind
to act like a soldier&rsquo;s daughter and granddaughter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at this moment, Fortescue, whose
image had been lingering in Betty&rsquo;s memory,
suddenly came to the front. She saw him in
her mind&rsquo;s eye, galloping past the window,
his military cloak around him, his cap set
firmly on his handsome head, his look, his attitude,
everything about him, proclaiming the
soldier. Betty&rsquo;s smile changed from mirth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>to one of dreamy anticipation. There is much
flavor in the wine of life at twenty.</p>

<p>She went to the window, and, putting her
hands on each side of her eyes, so that she
could look out into the gathering gloom of
the winter night, saw afar off the windows of
Rosehill shining with light. On the day after
Christmas she would see that young soldier
again. Betty made a rapid calculation&mdash;it
would be just twenty-six hours. At the
thought a smile began in Betty&rsquo;s soft eyes and
ended on her rosy lips.</p>

<span class="no-indent" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</span><br />

<span class="no-indent chap_name">KETTLE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Beginning</span> with Christmas Eve, there was
a party every night for Betty, and as wind
and weather count for nothing where merry
young people are concerned, Betty prepared
to go, in spite of the biting cold, and a knife-like
wind that came howling down from Labrador.
Uncle Cesar was to take her to the
parties, in the little, old-fashioned rockaway,
drawn by the one horse which was all the
stable of Holly Lodge could boast. The
homeliness of her equipage did not in the least
disconcert Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; as Betty said to herself,
&ldquo;everybody knows I am Betty Beverley of
Rosehill, and the Rosehill Beverleys can do as
they please about carriages and clothes, and a
blessed good thing it is, as the family is down
on its luck at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Betty had a variety of euphemisms to disguise
the unpleasant facts of life. Poverty
was being down on one&rsquo;s luck; simple clothes
were a joke; and shabbiness, a mere romantic
incident, for such was the glorious philosophy
of pretty Betty.</p>

<p>There were, however, no sighs or regrets
for Betty that Christmas Eve, as she looked
with shining eyes into her mirror. Her white
gown, made by her own clever fingers, fitted to
perfection, and revealed all the delicate loveliness
of her white neck and her slender arms.
Around her throat was her great-grandmother&rsquo;s
amethyst necklace, and her simple
bodice was draped with her great-grandmother&rsquo;s
lace bertha. Her rich hair, with its
soft tendrils curling upon her neck, was
adorned with a wreath of ivy leaves, and tiny
moss rosebuds from the rosebush in the
window of the sitting-room. This little
wreath gave Betty the look of a woodland
nymph. Aunt Tulip, who acted as lady&rsquo;s
maid, during the intervals of her duty as
cook, housemaid, and what not, was lost in
admiration, and suggested that Betty would
&ldquo;cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y ketch a beau.&rdquo; This simple flattery
delighted Betty, especially as all the time she
was dressing her mind was fixed upon the
charms of Lieutenant John Hope Fortescue
of the United States Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>When Betty was quite dressed, and had
given herself a final survey in the glass, Aunt
Tulip went down to see if the rockaway was
hitched up with old Whitey. Betty, left alone,
blew out the candles, and, drawing the curtains,
looked out of her window once more at
Rosehill, a mile across the open fields. Yes,
the house was lighted up cheerfully&mdash;it was
Betty&rsquo;s pet grievance that the place was unoccupied
for such long intervals. In some
way, after that visit from Jack Fortescue,
Betty was more reconciled to Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
owning Rosehill. She could imagine how jolly
it must be there with half a dozen young officers,
and if they were all as charming as Lieutenant
John Hope Fortescue&mdash;&mdash; Betty blushed
at the remembrance of her descent from the
top of the table into Fortescue&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>While Betty was chasing these fancies, like
white butterflies in the sun, she noticed a
small black figure far down the lane. It was
coming toward Holly Lodge, tramping with
short steps through the crust of snow. As
the object drew nearer, Betty&rsquo;s keen eyes discovered
that it was a small boy&mdash;a very small
boy. Betty wondered why so small a child
should be sent out in the winter night. When
he came within the circle of red light from the
front door, Betty saw that the boy was black
and very ragged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>By this, it was time for Betty to go downstairs
and show herself to the adoring eyes
of her grandfather. Colonel Beverley, sitting
in his great chair by the fire, surveyed
Betty with profound satisfaction as she
marched solemnly up and down, and pirouetted
before him to show her new white satin
slippers, with glittering buckles. From the
wreath of roses down to these little slippers,
the Colonel found Betty altogether adorable,
and told her so.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="350" height="246" alt="Woods" title="" />
</div>

<p>While Betty was giving stern orders to the
Colonel to go to bed promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock,
and not to smoke more than two pipes, Aunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>Tulip came into the sitting-room from the
nearby kitchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty,&rdquo; proclaimed Aunt Tulip, with
the air of announcing a catastrophe, &ldquo;what
you think done happen now? Them good-for-nothin&rsquo;
niggers that come here from I
dunno where, and brought a little boy wid
&rsquo;em, done gone away&mdash;they tooken the boat
to-day at the landin&rsquo;. And this heah boy as
ain&rsquo;t got no father nor no mother, and say he
doan&rsquo;s believe he never had none, got skeered
at the steamboat, and turn &rsquo;roun&rsquo; and run
away heah! What we gwine ter do &rsquo;bout
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring him in,&rdquo; cried Betty, suddenly remembering
the little boy she had seen creeping
through the snow.</p>

<p>Aunt Tulip disappeared and returned with
a small colored boy, very black, very ragged,
almost shoeless, but with beady eyes cheerful
as Betty&rsquo;s own, and a row of shining teeth
which he showed freely. The solemn book of
life evidently had no terrors for him.</p>

<p>As he saw Betty in her party gown, with
the wreath on her delicate head, a rapturous
look came into the eyes of the waif, his grin
broadened, he seemed to have a vision of
Paradise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; cried Betty, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s as black as the
kettle! What&rsquo;s your name, little boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Solomon &rsquo;Zekiel Timons,&rdquo; replied the
waif, now fairly laughing with joy amid his
rags.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo; asked the
Colonel.</p>

<p>Then Solomon &rsquo;Zekiel Timons, prompted
by Aunt Tulip, told his story. He lived with
some colored people who were always on the
move. Lately, they had been living not far
from Holly Lodge, and the waif knew Miss
Betty by sight, and thought she was &ldquo;the
beautifulest lady ever I see.&rdquo; He did not
know whether the colored people were related
to him or not, nor where he was born, nor anything
except his name. He had not been ill-treated,
but he did not always have enough to
eat, and he knew his &ldquo;clo&rsquo;es was mighty raggety.&rdquo;
The colored people were going somewhere
by the steamboat, and he had gone that
day to the wharf with them, their belongings
packed on an ox-cart. But on reaching the
wharf, and seeing the steamboat, Solomon
Ezekiel&rsquo;s heart had fainted within him. The
grin left his little black face, and his round
beady eyes grew terrified when he described
in jerky sentences the horrors of the steamboat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There wuz two gre&rsquo;t wheels,&rdquo; he gasped,
opening his arms wide, &ldquo;as big as dis heah
house&mdash;an&rsquo; they keeps on a-churnin&rsquo; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>a-churnin&rsquo;! An&rsquo; a awful thing on top de boat
goin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down like dis&rdquo;&mdash;here Solomon
&rsquo;Zekiel gave a very realistic imitation of the
propeller of a side-wheel steamer in motion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; den&rdquo;&mdash;his frightened voice sank to a
whisper&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;fo&rsquo; it reach de wharf, de steamboat
hollered&mdash;it jes&rsquo; keep on hollerin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
screechin&rsquo; an&rsquo; de smoke jes&rsquo; po&rsquo; outen a chimley,
an&rsquo; de steamboat everlastin&rsquo; hollerin&rsquo;.
An&rsquo; I wuz so skeered, I jes&rsquo; run offen de wharf
an&rsquo; come heah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Solomon &rsquo;Zekiel coolly ignored the fact
that the steamboat landing was five miles
away, and that he had trudged through the
biting cold and the snow, in his poor rags and
broken shoes, all that distance&mdash;and he was
a very little fellow indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had anything to eat since breakfast?&rdquo;
asked Betty, with melting eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, &rsquo;m,&rdquo; promptly answered Solomon
&rsquo;Zekiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is Christmas Eve!&rdquo; cried Betty.
&ldquo;Now Aunt Tulip will take you into the
kitchen and give you a good supper, Solomon
&rsquo;Zekiel&mdash;oh, I can&rsquo;t stand all that name&mdash;you
are as black as the kettle, so we&rsquo;ll just call you
Kettle for the present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His new name and the prospect of supper
seemed to delight the little negro beyond
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>By that time Uncle Cesar had driven the
rockaway up to the door, and the Colonel was
handing Betty in and muffling her up, as one
muffles up his chief and only treasure. Aunt
Tulip brought out Uncle Cesar&rsquo;s fiddle-case
with his fiddle, for Uncle Cesar was an essential
person in that neighborhood, on account
of his expert fiddling. Old Whitey, a big,
handsome horse, was dancing about in a
manner so sprightly, in spite of his thirteen
years, that Betty felt certain he would make
a good appearance at the Christmas hunt.</p>

<span class="chap_name no-indent">CHRISTMAS COMES BUT ONCE A YEAR</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not much after seven o&rsquo;clock, but
early hours are kept in the country, and there
was a six-mile drive between Holly Lodge and
Marrowbone. Betty enjoyed the drive, inhaling
the icy, crisp night air as if it were
champagne. Old Whitey did the six miles in
less than an hour, and Betty was in the thick
of the arrivals for the party. The hospitable
host, Major Lindsay&mdash;for there were many
majors and colonels in Virginia in those
days&mdash;met his guests on the great portico,
with the big wooden Doric columns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Betty?&rdquo; Major
Lindsay said. &ldquo;And where is the Colonel,
pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Granddaddy sent his compliments and regrets,
but he says he is really too rheumatic
to go out to dances,&rdquo; answered Betty, slipping
out of the rockaway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense!&rdquo; shouted the Major,
who was big and florid and handsome. &ldquo;The
Colonel is as able to shake a leg as ever he
was, by George! I hope Cesar has brought
the fiddle, because we are reckoning upon
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sirree,&rdquo; answered Uncle Cesar, with
important emphasis. &ldquo;I got some rheumatiz,
too, same like ole Marse, but mine is in my
legs, thank God A&rsquo;mighty, and ain&rsquo;t tech my
bow arm yet, praise the Lamb!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty tripped up the steps, and Major
Lindsay gallantly escorted her into the wide
hall.</p>

<p>Within this great hall were Christmas
mirth and cheeriness, and laughter and bright
eyes and gay smiles. The house, following
the plan of most houses of eastern Virginia,
had a splendid great hall, big enough for a
ball-room, and always used for dancing; for
the people of Virginia are inveterate dancers,
and a house is but poorly provided which cannot
furnish space for balls. Holly wreaths
were everywhere, and over each door was a
sprig of mistletoe, causing the ladies to
scamper through the doorways with little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>shrieks of laughter, while the gentlemen used
strategies to intercept them.</p>

<p>Already dancing had begun, though the
orchestra was by no means complete without
Uncle Cesar. But the impatient young feet
could not wait. Isaac Minkins, a saddle-colored
person, who combined the profession
of driving a fish-cart in the day-time and
fiddling in the evening, was the director of
the orchestra, and his sole assistant, until
Uncle Cesar arrived, was a coal black youth
who also helped on the fish-cart, and who
performed upon the concertina, or, as the
negroes call it, the &ldquo;lap organ.&rdquo; Uncle
Cesar, who was quickly hustled into the hall,
promptly tuned up and played second fiddle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="300" height="340" alt="Dresser and Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>By that time Betty had run upstairs,
thrown off her cloak, taken one hasty but
satisfactory view of herself in the mirror, and
was stepping daintily down the staircase.
Now, Betty, who was a scheming and designing
creature, knew exactly how to descend
the stairs into the dancing hall. This descent
down the fine staircase in full view of the
assembled company was an effective part of
the programme, and the artful Betty, with
an outspread fan in one hand and holding
up her filmy white skirts with the other just
enough to show her little white satin slippers,
was the prettiest picture imaginable. So
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
thought Lieutenant John Hope Fortescue of
the United States Army, and several other
admirers, both old and new. As Betty came
down the stairs with what appeared to be unstudied
grace, but was not, her soft eyes
swept the dancers below, and she nodded and
smiled back at those who recognized her. But
she did not see Fortescue until she was almost
at the last step, when he came forward and
took her hand. He had been strikingly handsome
in uniform, and he was scarcely less so
in his well fitting evening clothes, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>Betty, like all women, had a secret hankering
for uniforms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Beverley,&rdquo; said Fortescue,
and Betty gave a pretty little start of
real surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; she said, and then hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did I get here?&rdquo; said Fortescue,
laughing and answering the look of surprised
inquiry in Betty&rsquo;s eloquent face. &ldquo;The
greatest streak of luck that ever happened!
When I got back to Rosehill, I found Major
Lindsay had come to call&mdash;the kindest and
most hospitable people that ever lived are in
Virginia, I believe&mdash;and he invited us to come
over to this party. We fairly jumped down
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>his throat, I can tell you, we were so glad to
accept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am <i>so</i> glad you did,&rdquo; said Betty
affably.</p>

<p>She had never laid eyes on Fortescue until
four hours before, but Betty was Southern,
and a Virginian at that, and readily assumed
a tone of the warmest friendship with every
personable young man she met, immediately
after making his acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued Betty in an imploring
tone, as if there were not another man
within a hundred miles, &ldquo;will you be kind
enough to take me up to Mrs. Lindsay to
speak to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Fortescue, placing
her little gloved hand within his arm, and
improving his opportunities as he did so.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter for Betty to reach
Mrs. Lindsay, standing at the other end of
the hall. Betty was stopped every minute by
girls speaking to her, and by young men asking
dances of her. The girls called her
&ldquo;Betty&rdquo; and the young men called her &ldquo;Miss
Betty,&rdquo; so Fortescue promptly dropped the
formal &ldquo;Miss Beverley&rdquo; and called her &ldquo;Miss
Betty,&rdquo; as if he had known her for a hundred
years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the first fiddle and the &ldquo;lap
organ,&rdquo; reinforced by Uncle Cesar&rsquo;s stout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>bow arm, were playing energetically &ldquo;I&rsquo;se
Gwine Back to Dixie,&rdquo; and Betty&rsquo;s slender
feet danced rather than walked up the hall.
At last they were standing before Mrs. Lindsay,
stout, handsome, and florid, like the
Major, and receiving her guests with heartfelt
hospitality like her husband. The hostess
greeted Betty warmly, and, above the music
and merry chatter, screamed without any
punctuations whatever:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="468" height="200" alt="Storm" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do Betty so glad to see you
sorry your grandfather can&rsquo;t be here tell him
to rub his knees with turpentine every night.
Tom&rsquo;s brought four of his friends from the
University and you must dance with them
all so delighted to have Mr. Fortescue and the
other officers from Rosehill go right into the
library and get some hot biscuit and coffee
you must be so cold after your drive how do
you do,&rdquo; etc., etc., saying the same kind things
to the next arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>And then Tom Lindsay, a University of
Virginia sophomore, swooped down on Betty;
but just as he caught her hand, Fortescue,
who knew both how to act and to think, put
his arm around Betty&rsquo;s waist, and they
whirled off to the strains of &ldquo;I&rsquo;se gwine back
to Dixie, where the orange-blossoms blow.&rdquo;
Betty, however, managed to put her hand for
a second in Tom Lindsay&rsquo;s and to say, as
everybody said to everybody else:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so glad to see you! Have just been
dying of loneliness without you;&rdquo; and when
safely out of Tom&rsquo;s hearing Betty whispered
into Fortescue&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Such a nice boy! We
used to play together. Of course, I have to
say things like that to the child.&rdquo; By which
it may be seen that Miss Betty Beverley was
a most unprincipled person when it came to
dealing with personable young men, and did
not have the New England conscience or any
other conscience, where flattering a person
of the other sex was concerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="350" height="181" alt="Hounds" title="" />
</div>

<p>When the dance was over, Fortescue, like
an able commander, following up his advantage,
mentioned to Betty that they should
accept Mrs. Lindsay&rsquo;s suggestion and go into
the library and have the coffee and biscuits
which were always served immediately upon
the arrival of guests at a Virginia party.
This did not appeal particularly to Betty, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
when Tom Lindsay came up and told her that
he wanted to introduce his fellow students to
her, and they would all go into the library
together for coffee, Fortescue suddenly remembered
that he must introduce his brother
officers also to Betty. This was enough to
send Betty rapidly into the library, where she
found herself in an Elysium of University
students and second lieutenants. Being a
generous soul, Betty seized upon Sally Carteret,
a tall, handsome girl, and divided her
plunder of students and officers with Sally.
It was only necessary to mention that Mr.
Fortescue and his friends would stay over
Christmas day, for Sally to invite them to
the Christmas hunt and breakfast at Bendover.
Seeing there was no chance of monopolizing
Betty, Fortescue found Sally, with her
gypsy beauty, by no means a bad substitute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="350" height="246" alt="Woods" title="" />
</div>

<p>Between the dances, raids were made into
the library, where from a big table hot coffee
and buttered biscuits, with &ldquo;old ham&rdquo; that
had been cured in the smoke from hickory
ashes for a couple of years&mdash;a great Virginia
luxury&mdash;and a round of beef, were served as
a mere preliminary to the big supper which
was coming later. By the great fireplace stood
a table with a huge bowl of apple toddy. The
older gentlemen, who were at cards in the
drawing-room with prim, elderly ladies, made
frequent incursions upon the apple toddy.
The ladies carefully avoided this seductive
brew and kept to weak tea and thin biscuit.
Over all was the true spirit of Christmas
gaiety, the heart-whole and heart-given hospitality
of a hospitable people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="389" height="200" alt="Landscape" title="" />
</div>

<p>The dancing went on gaily until half past
eleven o&rsquo;clock, when the concoction of the
Christmas eggnog began. Every gentleman
was supplied with a silver fork and a plate
in which had been broken the whites of four
eggs. They had to be beaten so stiff that the
plate could be held over the head of a lady
without dropping upon her. Such was the
tradition, but only a few ladies took the risk,
holding out, meanwhile, their dainty handkerchiefs
over their heads to catch the whipped-up
whites in case they fell. Betty was one
of the venturesome ones, and Fortescue was
her cavalier, and turned the plate over her
head, but not a drop fell upon Betty&rsquo;s outspread
lace handkerchief. Then the whites
of the eggs were mixed with the beaten up
yolks and the whipped cream and the &ldquo;stiffening&rdquo;
as Major Lindsay called it, who, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>host, did the mixing, and then ladled out the
foaming eggnog. At twelve o&rsquo;clock exactly
Major Lindsay held up his glass and shouted,
&ldquo;Merry Christmas!&rdquo; and a great chorus went
up of &ldquo;Merry Christmas! Merry, merry
Christmas!&rdquo; Then, Isaac Minkins, with a
magnificent flourish of his bow, burst forth
into the strains of &ldquo;The Flowing Bowl.&rdquo;
All joined in the great Christmas song, Major
Lindsay&rsquo;s big baritone leading the chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For to-night we&rsquo;ll merry, merry be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to-night we&rsquo;ll merry, merry be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to-night we&rsquo;ll merry, merry be,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And to-morrow we&rsquo;ll be sober.&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the gentlemen roared out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the man who drinks good ale and goes to bed quite mellow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives as he ought to live, and dies a damned good fellow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives as he ought to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives as he ought to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives as he ought to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And dies a damned good fellow.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the man who drinks no ale and goes to bed quite sober.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He withers as the leaves do, and dies in the month of October.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He withers as the leaves do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He withers as the leaves do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He withers as the leaves do.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And dies in the month of October.&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>

<p>Then came the verse in which all the ladies
joined with great enthusiasm:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the girl who gets a kiss, and runs and tells her mother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May she live to be an old maid, and never get another!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The chorus pealed out, Betty Beverley&rsquo;s
clear and ringing soprano above all the rest:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;May she live to be an old maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May she live to be an old maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May she live to be an old maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And never get another.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the folding doors to the dining-room
were thrown open and the real supper was
served, to which coffee, biscuit, &ldquo;old ham,&rdquo;
and the round of beef were merely the appetizers.
An emperor of a turkey was at the
head of the table, with another at the foot,
and one at each side scarcely inferior in imperial
splendor. There were cold pickled
oysters, and hot oysters, creamed, steamed,
fried, stewed, and in scallop shells. There
were great dishes of terrapin, not indeed the
diamond-back of Maryland fame, but the
slider, a dry-land terrapin, an excellent creature
when accompanied with the butter,
cream, eggs, sherry, and brandy which are
lavished upon him. There were, of course,
more old hams, rounds of beef, and a gigantic
saddle of Southdown mutton, which Major
Lindsay himself carved with a magnificent
flourish. The boned turkey was a gem, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>work in the case being done by Dr. Markham,
the cheery, pleasant-faced village doctor,
who, it was popularly reported, in getting
the bones out of the turkey used the identical
instruments with which he cut off legs and
arms. But the doctor&rsquo;s services being in demand
by hostesses at Christmas time, no prejudice
existed against either the boned turkey
or the doctor.</p>

<p>There were pigeon-pie, wild ducks, chicken
salad, and a few other incidentals, to be
topped off by ices, custards, jellies, and cakes
of innumerable varieties. It took an hour
to get through with the supper, and when the
guests had feasted and left the dining-room,
there was still enough left to feed a couple of
regiments.</p>

<p>The musicians had had their supper and
a glass of apple toddy, and eggnog in addition,
and were ready again with fiddles and
&ldquo;lap organ&rdquo; to start the flying feet once
more. Betty had more partners than she
could accommodate, and told each one the
same story in various forms, punctuated by
a sidelong glance, which was Betty&rsquo;s own&mdash;that
she only wished she could dance with him
all the evening. Tom Lindsay, a handsome
youngster, who called Betty by her first name
and assumed proprietary rights over her,
was encouraged to do so by this arch-hypocrite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>of a girl. But in this Betty only followed
the prevailing fashion. All of the university
students and young officers present,
except Fortescue, found themselves involved
in at least half a dozen desperate flirtations,
which promised to continue during the whole
week, and then never to be heard of again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="468" height="200" alt="Storm" title="" />
</div>

<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock in the wintry Christmas
morning before the musicians tuned up for
the final Virginia reel. The two lines were
formed down the great hall, and extending
through the folding doors into the library.
The elders sat around, the card-players in the
drawing-room giving up their games of old-fashioned
whist to watch the dancers. Betty
Beverley had the honor of leading off with
Major Lindsay, an agile and graceful dancer
in spite of his two hundred pounds. Fortescue,
with the eye of a strategist, took the least
desirable position at the other end of the
line, but by this he acquired the privilege of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>meeting Betty in the middle of the line,
swinging her around first by the right hand
and then by the left, next by both hands and
then <i>dos--dos</i>, and passing under the arch.
The musicians played with the fire and enthusiasm
peculiar to their race. The fiddlers
wagged their heads, beat time with their feet,
flourished their bows, while the youth with
the &ldquo;lap organ&rdquo; stood up and fairly danced
with delight as the strains of &ldquo;Forked Deer&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Billy in the Low Grounds&rdquo; rent the air.</p>

<p>When the two ends of the reel were danced,
Major Lindsay and Betty tripped down the
middle, the Major cutting the pigeon-wing
and taking many quaint and curious steps,
which were followed by Betty&rsquo;s twinkling
feet. Then they danced back again, and began
swinging the row of dancers until they
had reached the end of the line again. The
march followed next, Betty leading the ladies,
and the Major leading the men, all clapping
time rhythmically with the dashing music.
This was gone through religiously with every
couple in the reel, and it took an hour to be
danced. Then, at last, it finished up in the
grand chain, everybody shaking hands with
everybody else, and wishing each other
&ldquo;Merry Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was still pitch dark in the December
morning, although past five o&rsquo;clock. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>carriages were brought up to the door, and
the ladies were shot into them, the horses
prancing in the freezing air and restless to
take the road. Betty was one of the last to
leave, as Uncle Cesar had to &ldquo;wrop up&rdquo; his
fiddle carefully, put it in the case, and carry
it tenderly out to the rockaway. Old Whitey
came up to the big Doric portico, stepping
high and snorting as if he were a colt. Major
Lindsay escorted Betty down the steps of
the great portico, but at the foot Fortescue,
bareheaded in the winter darkness, was waiting.
He gave Betty&rsquo;s slender hand one last
pressure, wrapped her delicate feet up
warmly in the blanket, and got a sweet parting
glance from the girl&rsquo;s fair eyes before
Uncle Cesar called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee up, ole hoss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty leaned back in the rockaway as old
Whitey trotted briskly along the frozen road.
She was in one of those happy dreams that
are the glorious heritage of sweet and twenty.
Her mind was divided between the charms of
dashing university students and charming
young officers, together with speculations as
to whether her white muslin gown really
would last through Christmas week. There
were several alarming rents in it already, for
Betty had enjoyed herself very, very much.</p>

<p>Then her thoughts turned to soberer things,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>such as the way the brave old Colonel stood
the translation from Rosehill to Holly Lodge,
and the necessity for making both ends meet,
and the building of a stable for their one cow.
For Betty&rsquo;s outside and inside by no means
corresponded. On the outside, she was all
laughter and singing and dancing, like a silver
fountain in the golden sun. Inside, she was
the most level-headed, the most thoughtful,
and the most courageous creature in the
world. Betty was practical and sentimental,
tender and cruel, gay and sad, bold and timorous,
and always Betty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span>, things had happened at Holly
Lodge. The Colonel had taken out his violin
and played dreamily the old airs, von Weber&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Last Waltz,&rdquo; &ldquo;Love Not,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bygone
Hours.&rdquo; At sixty-eight, one has many
Christmas days to look back upon. The
faithful heart of Aunt Tulip in the kitchen
was touched when the delicate strains of the
violin floated upon the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole Marse, he jes&rsquo; cipherin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Ciphering,
in the negro language, means brooding
with sadness and melancholy.</p>

<p>But then Aunt Tulip&rsquo;s attention was distracted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>by the newcomer, Kettle. The boy,
huddled close to the fire, his hands locked
around his knees, his shining black eyes fixed
on the blaze, was filled with deep content; he
was warm, he had had a good supper, and he
had escaped the dangers of the screaming
steamboat. Those who had left him behind
had not been too kind to him, and he had no
regrets for them. Suddenly his enjoyment of
the <i>dolce far niente</i> was rudely interrupted
by Aunt Tulip, who herself seldom indulged
in the sweet-do-nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look a-heah, boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo;
to give you a good washin&rsquo; and put you to
bed. Boys oughter be abed by this time, so
they k&rsquo;yarn&rsquo; git in no mo&rsquo; mischief &rsquo;twell
to-morrer mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>With that Kettle was ruthlessly seized, his
clothes stripped off him, and he was soused
in a washtub of warm water, while Aunt
Tulip, with a scrub-brush, and soft soap of
her own manufacture, scrubbed him from
head to foot, including his woolly head.
Kettle, who had rather dreaded the unusual
experience, enjoyed it before he got through.
Then Aunt Tulip, putting a nightgown of her
own on him, covered him up in a little pallet
she had made upon the floor of her own room,
next the kitchen, and in two minutes Kettle
had passed into the dreamless sleep of a tired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>little boy. Aunt Tulip began to examine the
boy&rsquo;s worn clothes. They were very ragged,
and his shoes quite beyond help. But clothes,
however ragged, may be washed and mended.
So Aunt Tulip, who had worked hard all that
day and every day, set herself the task of
having something decent for Kettle to put
on Christmas morning. She toiled at the
washtub while Betty, afar off, was dancing,
and the Colonel had long since gone to his
bedroom on the ground floor. After Kettle&rsquo;s
poor clothes were washed and ironed, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>were hung before the kitchen fire to dry, and
then Aunt Tulip, getting out her big work-basket
and brass thimble and putting on her
horn spectacles, began the work of mending
Kettle&rsquo;s rags. She patched and darned industriously,
and at last, with a sigh of profound
satisfaction, she folded up and laid
upon a chair Kettle&rsquo;s clothes, including his
jacket and trousers, neatly washed and
mended and decent. Nothing could be done
with his shoes, except to put some shoe-polish
on them, and this she did. The Christmas
stars looked down kindly upon the poor negro
woman toiling for one of God&rsquo;s poor, and the
Christmas angels wafted a benediction upon
her humble head.</p>

<p>When her labor was over, Aunt Tulip lay
down to rest for a couple of hours. She knew
well enough when Betty would return, and
the fire had to be started up in Betty&rsquo;s room,
and, after old Whitey had been put in the
stable, Uncle Cesar must have his hot coffee
and corn pone. For Aunt Tulip, like many
of her humble sort, was a minister of kindness
to all around her.</p>

<p>It was six o&rsquo;clock, but still the world was
all inky blackness when the wheels of the
rockaway crunched before the door of Holly
Lodge. The fire in Betty&rsquo;s room had been
stirred into a cheering blaze, and Aunt Tulip
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>was ready to help her out of her simple evening
gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declar, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Aunt Tulip,
as she unhooked Betty, &ldquo;how some folks kin
let a chile go as raggety as that air boy, I
doan&rsquo; see.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="300" height="340" alt="Dresser and Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s mind came back from officers and
university students to Kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must try and get him some decent
clothes, Mammy,&rdquo; answered Betty, Aunt
Tulip having been Betty&rsquo;s mammy in her
baby days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; continued Aunt Tulip, &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>boy has got sumpin&rsquo; decent fur Chris&rsquo;mus
mornin&rsquo;. I done washed his clo&rsquo;es an&rsquo; mended
&rsquo;em up the bes&rsquo; I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And were you washing and ironing and
mending all this Christmas night?&rdquo; asked
Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Aunt Tulip, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mind settin&rsquo; up an&rsquo; gittin&rsquo; the boy&rsquo;s things
kinder decent. But, Miss Betty, the boy has
got to have a Chris&rsquo;mus stockin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;You can put
some apples and oranges and nuts in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; Cesar an&rsquo; me kin give him a quarter
apiece to&rsquo;des a new pair of shoes. His shoes
ain&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;tall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty dived into her dressing-table drawer
and took out of her little purse a dollar bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is from Grandfather, for the
shoes, too. He would never forgive us if
something wasn&rsquo;t put into the boy&rsquo;s stocking
from him. Now, what can I think of to give
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo; got no collar nor cravat,&rdquo; said
Aunt Tulip. &ldquo;He would look right nice to-morrer
if he jes&rsquo; had a collar and cravat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty was well off in collars, and produced
four. Then, unfastening the scarlet ribbon
from around her waist, she seized her needle
and thimble, and in five minutes had sewed
the ribbon into a large and very presentable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>cravat, and proceeded to fringe out the ends.
Aunt Tulip watched her with delighted eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that chile will be
tickled to death when he gits his Chris&rsquo;mus
stockin&rsquo;. An&rsquo; you know, Miss Betty, I been
thinkin&rsquo; that boy could be mighty useful at
Holly Lodge, pickin&rsquo; up chips and carryin&rsquo;
the wood upstairs and huntin&rsquo; up the
turkeys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; replied Betty, rolling up
the cravat and the collars. &ldquo;If he is any good,
he could save you and Uncle Cesar a great
many steps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently, Betty was in her little white bed
for a short nap, because she could not think
of not being up and dressed on Christmas
morning, although she had danced twenty-five
miles between eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening
and five in the morning. Aunt Tulip, too, took
what she called her &ldquo;cat nap,&rdquo; and at eight
o&rsquo;clock on Christmas morning everything
was awake and stirring at Holly Lodge.</p>

<span class="chap_name no-indent">FORTESCUE AND ROSES AND
BIRDSEYE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Christmas sun was shining brilliantly,
and it was not so desperately cold as the day
before. Betty had hopes that the thin skim
of snow would melt, so that the scent would
lie for the fox-hunt the next morning. She
ran downstairs as soon as she was dressed,
and found the Colonel standing on the hearth-rug,
his back to the fire, and his eyes turned
resolutely away from Rosehill. Betty kissed
him all over his face, and commanded him
to be cheerful, as everybody should be on
Christmas morning. Then Aunt Tulip and
Uncle Cesar were called in for their simple
gifts, and Kettle appeared with them, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>clothes clean and respectable-looking. There
was much talk between the Colonel and Uncle
Cesar over Christmas days long past, and the
Colonel, whatever his heart might be, carried
out to the letter Betty&rsquo;s injunction to be
cheerful. As for Kettle, the sight of his
Christmas stocking and his treasures, the
collars and the gorgeous red cravat, and the
magnificent prospect of a pair of new shoes,
completely overwhelmed him. He could only
look first at Betty and then at Aunt Tulip,
and say to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the fust Chris&rsquo;mus I ever see; the
fust Chris&rsquo;mus I ever see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever have a Christmas stocking
before, Kettle?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, Miss,&rdquo; answered Kettle. &ldquo;I done
heah &rsquo;bout &rsquo;em, but I ain&rsquo;t never had none
befo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle&rsquo;s bliss was further augmented when
Aunt Tulip put a standing collar around his
neck and tied the flaming red necktie under
his chin. All was then swallowed up in
Kettle&rsquo;s rapture over his own appearance.
He stood before the old-fashioned mirror over
the pier table, his head barely reaching the
top; his mouth came open as if it were on
hinges, his eyes danced in his head, and words
failed him. There are moments of rapture
when speech is a superfluity, and so it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>with Kettle when he beheld himself in his first
cravat, and that a large one of brilliant red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boy,&rdquo; said Aunt Tulip severely,
who did not believe in wasting indulgences on
boys, &ldquo;now that Miss Betty and ole Marse
done been so good to you, you got to do all
you kin to holp along. You got to pick up
chips an&rsquo; fotch water an&rsquo; black ole Marse&rsquo;s
shoes an&rsquo; do everything you know how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y will,&rdquo; answered Kettle fervently.
And then the divine spirit of gratitude
appeared in his eyes, and he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo; gwine to fergit that you washed
my clo&rsquo;es.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; washed you, too,&rdquo; replied Aunt
Tulip. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you got to do it yourself every
day, or I&rsquo;ll see to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This awful and indefinite threat impressed
Kettle with a wholesome fear of the most
harmless creature on earth&mdash;Aunt Tulip.</p>

<p>Then breakfast was served, and Kettle received
his first lessons in bringing in batter-cakes.
In the intervals between the relays of
hot batter-cakes, Kettle glued his eyes to his
own image in the glass with a vanity second
only to that of Narcissus.</p>

<p>Of course, the Colonel had to hear all about
the party, and who was there, and if the regulation
Christmas festivities were thoroughly
carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;we celebrated
Christmas that way at Rosehill, with an unstinted
hospitality. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you,&rdquo; cried Betty, sternly
from across the table, &ldquo;that you were not to
make a single complaint against Fate on
Christmas Day? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you yesterday
I knew this was going to be the pleasantest
Christmas I ever had? So far it certainly
has been. The dance last night was the most
heavenly thing&mdash;my gown is in ribbons, but
I can mend it up all right, and put in a couple
of new breadths later in the week. And Mr.
Fortescue told me he thought that a white
muslin gown at Christmas time, with scarlet
ribbons and a wreath of geranium leaves,
with moss rosebuds, was the most beautiful
and poetic costume a girl could wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s white teeth showed under his
trim gray moustache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortescue knows how to pay compliments,
my dear,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;A man who
doesn&rsquo;t know how to pay compliments and
isn&rsquo;t equal to telling colossal fibs to the girl
he is dancing with, isn&rsquo;t the man for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When breakfast was over Uncle Cesar
brought in the only melancholy news of the
day. Old Whitey had gone lame, and there
was no going to church that day, nor was it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>likely that he would be fit to ride the next
day at the hunt. Betty sighed deeply. The
crust of snow was rapidly disappearing, and
the ground would be in good condition for the
hunt. However, Betty was of a hopeful nature,
and felt sure that a horse would drop
down out of the clouds for her to ride.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="350" height="179" alt="Church" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Christmas dinner was to be served at
the old-fashioned hour of four o&rsquo;clock, so
when breakfast was over and Betty had paid
a visit to old Whitey, she went up to her room
and, throwing herself upon her bed, began to
make up her lost arrears of sleep. The Colonel
was downstairs absorbed in his new histories,
which Betty had given him for his
Christmas gift, and Betty slept peacefully
until it was quite three o&rsquo;clock, and the winter
sun was beginning to decline. Then, as she
lay awake thinking pleasant thoughts, her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>door was noiselessly opened, and Kettle appeared
above his red cravat, carrying a big
bouquet of white roses. He laid the roses
down on Betty&rsquo;s pillow, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gent&rsquo;man who fotch &rsquo;em is downstairs&mdash;Mr.
Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty sat up and buried her face in the fresh
roses. She knew them well. They came from
the greenhouse at Rosehill, and she herself
had taught them to bloom late and luxuriantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the gentleman I will be down immediately,&rdquo;
she said, and then, running to her
mirror, proceeded to make a fetching toilette
out of very simple elements. Her well fitting
dark blue gown set off her slender figure, and
when she came into the sitting-room, carrying
her huge bunch of roses, Fortescue, who sat
talking to the Colonel, thought she looked like
a peach ripening on the southern wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you so much,&rdquo; said Betty sweetly
to Fortescue. &ldquo;I tended the roses in the
greenhouse at Rosehill as long as we lived
there. We have no greenhouse here, so we
couldn&rsquo;t bring the rosebushes with us. But
I always had roses for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I hope you will always have roses for
Christmas,&rdquo; replied Fortescue gallantly.</p>

<p>Then they sat and talked gaily together as
young people do, of dances and hunting and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>all of the great affairs of youth, the Colonel
putting in a word occasionally. Fortescue
was lucky enough to be asked to all the Christmas
parties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to give a party
at Rosehill, but I don&rsquo;t know how. I am only
a man, you know. I should wish to do it right,
but I am afraid I can&rsquo;t make it quite as it
ought to be on short notice. Now, next Christmas,
if I can get leave, I will have a party,
too. That is, if you, Miss Betty, will help
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel liked the modesty of this
speech, and at once said that Betty would
help.</p>

<p>Then Betty told the melancholy story of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>old Whitey&rsquo;s lameness. Fortunately, Sally
Carteret, knowing that old Whitey had to be
saved for the hunt, had invited Betty to go
with her to the party that evening at Red
Plains, which was close by.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; asked Fortescue, &ldquo;that
you are to miss the hunt?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="389" height="200" alt="Landscape" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; said poor Betty dolefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t to be thought of,&rdquo; cried
Fortescue. &ldquo;I have several horses at Rosehill,
and I can give you a mount. Birdseye,
that I rode over here, is the gentlest and
kindest horse that ever stepped. Although
not a regular hunter, she can get along the
road and over the fences all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, jumping up, &ldquo;do
let me see her! Granddaddy, may I ride
Birdseye to-morrow morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should require, my love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>see Birdseye. Perhaps she has never had a
side-saddle on her, or known what a riding-skirt
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can try her,&rdquo; suggested Fortescue.</p>

<p>Betty ran out into the little hall, and, picking
up a red scarf, threw it over her head,
calling back to the Colonel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare, Granddaddy, to come out
on the porch. You can see from the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue was not a foot behind Betty, and
they both ran to where Birdseye, dancing to
keep herself warm, stood under a great holly
tree. From the kitchen window peeped a
little round, black face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can try Birdseye with that little black
boy,&rdquo; said Fortescue. &ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a
baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty beckoned to Kettle, who came out
willingly enough, his constitutional grin over-spreading
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run to the stable and get a horse-blanket,&rdquo;
said Betty, which Kettle proceeded
to do, and returned in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>But Kettle&rsquo;s face suddenly changed when
Fortescue, catching him by the shoulder,
wrapped the horse-blanket around him as if
it were a skirt, and Betty supplied a couple
of hair-pins with which to fasten it. Then
Fortescue, flinging the boy on Birdseye&rsquo;s
back, put the reins in his hand, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you little scamp, gallop around the
lawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle, his scared eyes nearly bouncing out
of his little black face, his grin wholly disappeared,
was quite incapable of taking a gallop
around the lawn of his own initiative. He
clung desperately to the reins, and began to
stutter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;G-g-g-g-ood Gord A&rsquo;mighty, Miss Betty!
I&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; skeered to death of this heah hoss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Birdseye, however, well bred, well behaved,
and intelligent, paid no attention to the
squirming, frightened burden upon her
shapely back. Fortescue, taking her by the
bridle, led her to the paling around the little
lawn, and then, with a twig broken from a
big holly tree, gave her a sharp cut on the
flank. Birdseye knew what was expected,
and, rising, she made a beautiful standing
jump over the paling. At that Kettle, with a
yell, dropped the reins and grabbed the mare
around the neck with both arms. Not even
this could disturb Birdseye&rsquo;s admirable
poise. Fortescue himself made a standing
leap over the paling and, running Birdseye
around, made her do another beautiful jump
over the paling. By that time, not even fear
of Fortescue or love of Betty could keep
Kettle on Birdseye&rsquo;s back another minute.
As soon as she came to a standstill, he tore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>off the horse-blanket and, dropping to the
ground, ran as fast as his short legs could
carry him into the kitchen, and disappeared.</p>

<p>The Colonel, who was watching from the
window, tapped his approval on the window-pane.
Fortescue then mounted, and, riding
off some distance in the field, came back at a
swinging gallop, and Birdseye took the paling
most beautifully in her stride, flying over it
like a bird. Betty immediately fell deeply in
love with Birdseye, and declared that she
must go upstairs and put on her habit, and
test the horse for herself. In a little while,
she came down, more bewitching than ever to
Fortescue&rsquo;s eyes, in her trim black habit and
little beaver hat.</p>

<p>Fortescue, mindful of Colonel Beverley&rsquo;s
scrutiny, put Betty on horseback in the old
way, by taking her slim foot in his hand, and
Betty stiffening her knee and rising into the
side-saddle, which had been put on Birdseye&rsquo;s
back. Betty did the standing leap beautifully
half a dozen times, and then, riding off in the
field, turned and came back, and Birdseye
made a running leap like the flight of a lapwing.
Fortescue had no doubt that Betty
was quite safe by her own horsemanship on
Birdseye&rsquo;s back. They were so interested in
their pastime that they forgot the passing of
the hours. The Christmas dinner at Holly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>Lodge was served at four o&rsquo;clock, and just
before the hour Uncle Cesar came out of the
house and said with a courtly bow to Fortescue:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole Marse, he say it is mos&rsquo; fou&rsquo; o&rsquo;clock,
an&rsquo; you mus&rsquo; come in an&rsquo; have Christmas
dinner with Miss Betty an&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue demurred a little, meaning all
the while to accept. His riding clothes were
hardly suitable, he said. But Betty clinched
the matter by saying to Uncle Cesar:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the Colonel that Mr. Fortescue will
stay to dinner, and hopes his riding clothes
will be excused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was just time for Betty to skip upstairs
and jump into a little gown of a pale
and jocund yellow, with an open neck, around
which she hung the Colonel&rsquo;s Christmas gift,
the little locket. The elbow sleeves showed
her dimpled arms, and with deliberate
coquetry she put in her shining hair one of
the white roses Fortescue had brought her,
and another over her innocent and affectionate
little heart. When she entered the sitting-room,
which served also as a dining-room,
Betty was justly triumphant. She
knew that she was looking her best.</p>

<span class="no-indent" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />

<span class="chap_name no-indent">THE SHADOW OF THE PAST</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was not much money at Holly Lodge,
but Christmas dinners were ridiculously
cheap, and some of earth&rsquo;s choicest products
lay almost at the door of the little house.
Fortescue thought he had never seen so noble
a turkey or such captivating oysters, and
when the plum pudding was brought in with a
sprig of holly stuck in it and surrounded by
a sea of fire, he hypocritically pretended he
had never before seen anything like it.</p>

<p>He settled the question of his absence from
Rosehill and his guests, by saying debonairly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Those fellows at Rosehill will get along
all right. With a soldier, one must catch
pleasure on the wing. And every one of the
fellows would stay, just as I do, if they had
half a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the way the youngsters talked
in my time,&rdquo; said the Colonel, laughing.
&ldquo;War and the ladies, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel grew reminiscent of past
Christmas days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recollect one in particular,&rdquo; he said
grimly: &ldquo;the Christmas of &rsquo;64 in the trenches
at Petersburg, when it was snowing and freezing
and hailing, and we had nothing to eat,
and death and defeat stalked with us. Don&rsquo;t
you remember that Christmas, boy?&rdquo; asked
the Colonel of Uncle Cesar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows I does,&rdquo; responded Uncle
Cesar fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That boy,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, indicating
the gray-haired Cesar, &ldquo;was my body-servant
during the whole war. He is an
arrant coward, and would run away if he
thought there was a Yankee within five miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Cesar bore this imputation upon his
personal courage with a broad grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I warn&rsquo;t no soldier-man, ole Marse,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;I was jes&rsquo; your body-servant,
and I was skeered of Yankees, and I&rsquo;se
skeered of &rsquo;em now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>At this, Fortescue laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of me, Uncle
Cesar,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>But Uncle Cesar shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yankees is mighty cur&rsquo;rus. In the wartime,
they jes&rsquo; as soon kill a man as wring a
chicken&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must say,&rdquo; added the Colonel,
&ldquo;that although Cesar always disappeared
promptly as soon as we got into a dangerous
place, he invariably turned up when the
trouble was over, and with something hot for
me to eat or something to drink&mdash;which he
called coffee, and was almost as good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twuz parched corn, an&rsquo; taters cut up an&rsquo;
roasted. An&rsquo; mos&rsquo; in gineral, I could find
somebody&rsquo;s cow to milk for ole Marse,&rdquo; Uncle
Cesar added with another grin.</p>

<p>The Colonel chuckled at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That black rascal, sir,&rdquo; he said, indicating
the faithful and devoted servitor,
&ldquo;could milk a cow into a bottle and never
spill a drop. But there weren&rsquo;t any cows to
rob in the trenches around Petersburg that
Christmas day of &rsquo;64, eh, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s tone was joking, but in his
eyes, as they met those of his gray-haired
&ldquo;boy,&rdquo; was a sombre expression. The bygone
tragedy rose before the old soldier and
his &ldquo;boy.&rdquo; Once more they saw the pinched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>faces of the starving soldiers, the scanty portions
of miserable food, the agonies of cold
and hunger, and from the far-off years came
back the sullen booming of the cannon, the
frightful shriek of the bursting shells, the
cracking of bullets. &ldquo;In the trenches&rdquo;&mdash;the
phrase was enough to raise gruesome ghosts
and awful phantoms from their bloody graves.</p>

<p>It was Betty who brought the two old men
away from sad Christmas memories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Granddaddy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all
over now, thank heaven, and we have everything
to be proud of on both sides. I am so
glad that I am a soldier&rsquo;s daughter, and so
proud when I can say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, Fortescue, who quickly adopted
the quaint and old-fashioned customs of people
like Colonel Beverley and Betty, rose
from the table and gave Betty a military
salute, which delighted her beyond words.</p>

<p>When dinner was over, Betty insisted that
Fortescue should instruct her in the manual
of arms, and, with a broomstick for a gun,
Betty went through with the whole manual,
to the Colonel&rsquo;s intense delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;She would make
a magnificent recruit!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center2">HER GRACEFUL FIGURE MAKING TO FORTESCUE THE
PRETTIEST PICTURE HE HAD EVER SEEN</p></div>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

<p>It was then growing dusk, and the Colonel
reminded Betty that it was the usual hour she
always sang to her harp for him. Fortescue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
took the green baize cover off the harp, and
Betty played and sang, her graceful figure
and lovely, rounded arms making to Fortescue
the prettiest picture he had ever seen.
She had a sweet, untrained voice, like a bird
in the forest, and sang to perfection the old-fashioned,
sentimental songs the Colonel
loved.</p>

</div>

<p>Six o&rsquo;clock came all too soon, and Fortescue,
forced to remember his duties as host,
at last reluctantly rose to go. They were,
however, to meet in a few hours at the Red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>Plains ball. As Fortescue galloped along the
frozen road between Holly Lodge and Rosehill,
he thought he had never had so pleasant
a Christmas day. It was all simple and innocent
pleasure, like the pastimes of children,
but it was not the less joyous and satisfying
on that account. Fortescue came to the conclusion
that a great deal of beauty, joy,
charm, goodness, and merriment, and even
the sublime thing called &ldquo;happiness,&rdquo; might
be found in a little brown house with one
sitting-room and one chimney, and on a place
with only one cow and one horse.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">LOVE AND THE CHASE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Betty was dressing, with Aunt
Tulip as lady&rsquo;s maid, for the Red Plains
party, the subject of Kettle was under discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That chile,&rdquo; said Aunt Tulip, &ldquo;went an&rsquo;
hide hisself as soon as he got offen Mr. Fortescue&rsquo;s
hoss, an&rsquo; when I went to hunt fur
him, if you believe me, Miss Betty, I foun&rsquo;
him way up in the lof&rsquo; over the kitchen,
trimblin&rsquo; like a leaf, an&rsquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t come
down &rsquo;twell he see Mr. Fortescue had done
rode away. Then he tell Cesar he could milk,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>an&rsquo; he tooken the bucket an&rsquo; went out an&rsquo;
milk ole Bossy as good as ever you see a cow
milked in your life, an&rsquo; he brung in enough
wood fur the whole house, an&rsquo; help Cesar to
feed ole Whitey. That boy is mighty industr&rsquo;ous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was encouraging news, and induced
Betty to think that Kettle would certainly be
worth his keep.</p>

<p>At half past eight, Sally Carteret, in the
big family carriage, came for Betty, and the
two girls drove over to Red Plains. The ball
was a replica of the dance at Marrowbone.
It is not often in life that one can live over
so much as a single hour of happiness, but
Betty lived over a whole evening of joy.
There was Fortescue, who claimed her hand
ruthlessly for many dances, and his brother
officers, who were scarcely less fascinating to
Betty, and the University students, who assumed
great intimacy upon short acquaintance,
and old friends, with whom she had
danced at dancing school. And there was the
same merriment and the same music&mdash;Isaac
Minkins and Uncle Cesar with their fiddles,
and the colored youth with his &ldquo;lap organ&rdquo;&mdash;and
the same kind of supper, the same kind
of eggnog, and the same songs, and the same
hearty Christmas spirit. The dance, though,
did not last so late, as the hunt would begin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>early in the morning, and Betty was back at
Holly Lodge and in bed by two o&rsquo;clock. She
had warned Aunt Tulip not to disturb herself
so early to make a fire for Betty to dress
by, but to send Kettle. At half past five,
Kettle knocked at Betty&rsquo;s door, and in two
minutes a gorgeous fire called Betty from her
bed. At six o&rsquo;clock in the wintry morning,
just as Betty was pulling on her gauntlets,
she heard the tramp of horses&rsquo; hoofs under
her window. Uncle Cesar had the side-saddle
ready, and when Betty went downstairs, Fortescue
was tightening the girths on Birdseye.
As the Colonel was not there to watch, Fortescue,
in the darkness, took Betty&rsquo;s slender
waist in his hands and swung her, by the
modern fashion, into the saddle. Although
it was still cold, the icy grip had moderated
a little, and the ground was clear. Betty and
Fortescue galloped along in the ghostly darkness,
saying little, but with a delightful feeling
of nearness and aloneness.</p>

<p class="center2 no-indent">THE SCENT LAY ACROSS THE OPEN FIELDS AND STRAGGLING WOODLANDS</p></div>

<p class="gap">&#160;</p>

<p>The day was breaking when they dismounted
before the great portico at Bendover.
The huntsmen were gathering rapidly,
and there were several ladies to join the hunt.
Negro boys were leading the steaming horses
up and down, while the huntsmen passed into
the hospitable house. Breakfast was smoking
on the table, and there was a constant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>procession of hot coffee from the kitchen,
with the inevitable five kinds of bread which
Virginia hospitality imperatively requires
for breakfast. There were so many dishes
that the long table would not accommodate
them, and there was a semicircle of oysters,
sausage, deviled bones, and other substantials
around the broad open hearth. The breakfast,
though plentiful, was hurried, so that
the start could be made before the sun dried
the rime off the ground. Everybody laughed
and talked and nobody listened. In half an
hour they were crowding out upon the lawn
to mount. As it was a Christmas hunt, every
horse carried in his headstall a sprig of holly
berries. Of the half-dozen girls present,
each had her special cavalier, Fortescue, of
course, being the escort of Betty on her new
mount. The hounds, impatient to be off,
yelped fretfully as they trotted about with
their noses to the ground, sniffing eagerly.
The horses, knowing what was up, were keen
to stretch their legs. That day&rsquo;s quarry was
to be a very astute old red fox, which had
devastated many chicken-coops in the smaller
homesteads in the highlands, as the slightly
rolling country beyond the river shore was
called.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="350" height="181" alt="Hounds" title="" />
</div>

<p>At last the hunt was off for a screeching
run. About four miles from Bendover, Rattler,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>the Nestor of the pack of hounds, caught
the scent, and, lifting his head, gave one short,
loud yelp of triumph, and then dashed away,
making straight for a straggling skirt of
woods. There was a rough cart-road through
it, and along this the huntsmen galloped, the
dogs crying near to them. Fortescue rode
close to Betty&rsquo;s pommel. Birdseye maintained
her character, and Betty thought she
had never known so good a mount. It had
been Fortescue&rsquo;s expectation that Betty
would be merely a spectator of the hunt, but
with such a horse as Birdseye under her
Betty rode straight and followed the hounds.
The scent lay across the open fields and straggling
woodlands, and was not particularly
rough, but Betty took all that came in her
way. Birdseye was naturally a beautiful
jumper, and, like many horses, took to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>sport with joy. Fortescue admired Betty&rsquo;s
lithe figure on the galloping horse, her delicate
cheeks deeply flushed, and the little vagrant
tendrils of hair, escaped from her filmy
veil, streaming upon the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="389" height="200" alt="Lone Tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>There was a roaring run of an hour, and
then, in the midst of an open place in the
woods, the scent was lost. The huntsmen
pulled up, and the hounds, at fault, rushed
whimpering from one spot to another. The
horses were breathed, but Birdseye&rsquo;s wind,
like everything else about her, was admirable,
and she was impatient to be off again. After
half an hour of uncertainty, the hounds running
hither and yon, the trail was again
struck, and the whole pack, led by Rattler,
went shrieking on their way, in full cry.
There was another hour&rsquo;s hard run, and
then, close to a little farmhouse, and on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>edge of the poultry yard where the red fox
had found his prey, he met the doom of justice.
The dogs closed in upon him, and although
the fox, vicious to the last, snarled
and bit furiously, the day of vengeance was at
hand. At that moment every huntsman put
spurs to his horse, that he might be first in
at the death, but to Fortescue this honor came.
The master of the hunt rode up and dismounted.
There was no ceremony of throwing
his whip upon the ground, for the foxes
were really pests, and were meant to be destroyed.
The scoundrel fox by that time lay
dead upon the ground, and the master handed
his knife to Fortescue, who cut off the brush,
a splendid one, thick and long. Betty&rsquo;s heart
beat as she rode up with the others. The
master was on the ground, patting and encouraging
the dogs. Fortescue was also on
the ground. The presentation of the brush
could not take place until it had been washed
and prepared, but a word or two and a look
from Fortescue&rsquo;s laughing eyes conveyed to
Betty that she was to receive the honor.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">THE FLYING FEET OF THE
DANCERS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now after ten o&rsquo;clock, and, although
they had ridden a good fifteen miles, much
of it had been in a circle, and they were not
more than five miles from Bendover. Sally
Carteret led the procession back to Bendover,
along the country roads, in the clear wintry
noon. The farmers and their wives came
running out to their gates to know if the fox
was killed, and rejoiced to know that he was
dead on the very scene of his iniquities.</p>

<p>The sharp air and the exciting exercise had
fired the blood of all. They laughed and sang,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>and the gentlemen complimented the ladies
upon their pluck, and got compliments in return.
Fortescue thought that the clock of the
centuries had turned back&mdash;it was so quaint,
so old-fashioned. The modern, eager, bustling,
anxious world was forgotten; it was like
the hunting and hawking of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>The cavalcade rode onto the lawn at Bendover
soon after twelve o&rsquo;clock. Other guests
had arrived by that time, and then was served
the real hunt breakfast. The hunting people
had the keen appetites that are bred by five
hours in the saddle on a wintry day, and
swarmed merrily into the dining-room, where
the long table was again set out with the inev<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>itable
deviled turkey, oysters, old hams, and
all the seductions of a Virginia hunt breakfast.
When at last breakfast was over, the brush,
which had been cleaned and rudely mounted
in a wooden splint, was brought in, and Fortescue,
with a little speech presented it to
Betty. Then, somebody began the old hunting
song of &ldquo;John Peel,&rdquo; which accompanies
the ceremony of presenting the brush, and a
rousing chorus rang out&mdash;it is easy to start
a rousing chorus at Christmas time in Virginia,
especially when the memory of John
Peel is recalled at a Christmas hunt.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;D&rsquo; ye ken John Peel, d&rsquo; ye ken John Peel,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With his horse and his hounds in the morning?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His view-halloo will awaken the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Or the fox from his lair in the morning.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sally Carteret went to the piano in the
drawing-room and began to play a waltz.
That was enough. In half a minute every girl
in the party was waltzing with her cavalier,
in the big uncarpeted hall. The girls who had
ridden to the hounds tucked up their short
riding-skirts and danced energetically, for a
Virginia girl is born and lives dancing. Of
course, Fortescue had the first waltz with
Betty, and saw in her eyes a shy kindness that
thrilled him. When Sally Carteret had done
her duty at the piano, another girl took her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>place conscientiously, and gave Sally her
chance with the gentlemen, especially Sheldon,
one of the young officers who were guests
at Rosehill, and who had developed an admiration
for Sally scarcely inferior to Fortescue&rsquo;s
for Betty Beverley.</p>

<p>The dancing kept up for an hour or two,
but as there was a ball ahead for that night,
and for every night that week, the party dispersed
by three o&rsquo;clock. Some went home,
others were quartered in the neighborhood,
for the Virginia houses were always wide
open to guests for the night as well as for the
day.</p>

<p>Betty, with the fox-brush fastened to her
pommel, rode back in triumph to Holly
Lodge, escorted by Fortescue and his three
guests. The Colonel hobbled out with his
stick to greet Betty, and afar off down the
little lane Betty saw him, and waved the brush
at him triumphantly. When the party rode
up to the little porch, Fortescue flung himself
off his horse and assisted Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, Granddaddy!&rdquo; cried Betty, running
up the steps and shaking the brush at the
Colonel. &ldquo;Mr. Fortescue won it and gave it
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most complimentary of Mr. Fortescue,&rdquo;
said the Colonel, giving a splendid military
salute to Fortescue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>The Colonel was glad that his little granddaughter
had received the compliment, because,
being more worldly wise than Betty, he
understood what the fall meant from Rosehill
to Holly Lodge. But the kind and hospitable
county people saw no difference, and Betty
Beverley of Holly Lodge received the same
attentions as Betty Beverley of Rosehill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Holly Lodge" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Colonel invited the young officers in to
have a toddy, to which they promptly agreed,
eating and drinking and dancing being obligations
of a high order in that community.
The Colonel, standing grandly, glass in hand,
gave his favorite toast:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, accept the assurances of my
distinguished consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>Then, with many promises to meet again
that evening, and engagements for dances,
Fortescue and his friends mounted and rode
away, and Betty, after telling the Colonel the
incidents of the hunt, went up to her little
room to catch a few hours of sleep; for sleep
had to be caught at odd times during Christmas
week.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="350" height="181" alt="Hounds" title="" />
</div>

<p>Again that night and every night was a
dance, each a repetition of the other, for there
was not much room for variety, and the same
resources were at the command of all. Fortescue,
imbibing the hearty spirit of the community,
longed, as he had said at Holly
Lodge, to have a ball at Rosehill, but a certain
delicacy and tenderness toward Betty
and the Colonel hindered him. He did not
like to assume too quickly the rle of the
master of Rosehill, and, then, a dream was
dawning upon him of a ball at Rosehill, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>Betty should be the chatelaine and receive
with him. They made great strides toward
intimacy, and once in the maze of the last
waltz before daybreak Fortescue chose to forget
the &ldquo;Miss&rdquo; to Betty&rsquo;s name and in her
ear called her &ldquo;Betty.&rdquo; Betty pretended not
to hear it, but it thrilled her from head to
foot.</p>

<p>Fortescue was no laggard in love, but he
had the chivalrous, old-fashioned notion that
a girl was to be courted, and that he had to
show his devotion in other ways than by many
dances with Betty and visits to Holly Lodge
before he could dare to ask Betty for the
royal treasure of her love. Perhaps, he
thought, in six months, by showing her unvarying
attention and remembrance, he might
dare to speak the winged word, and possibly
Betty might then condescend to listen to him.
For Fortescue, in a simple, manly way, was
as unsophisticated as Betty. Moreover, he
had a deadly fear of the Colonel, and considered
that he had entered upon a regular
campaign, instead of merely attempting a
sortie upon the enemy.</p>

<p>On the afternoon before Fortescue&rsquo;s leave
was up, he proposed a skating party upon the
frozen river. There were few skaters among
the girls, for the river and ice-ponds were
not frozen often enough to incline them to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>sport. Betty, however, could skate prettily,
especially with Fortescue&rsquo;s arm to support
her. They were in full sight of the windows
of Holly Lodge, the Colonel, who knew the
ice in that latitude was treacherous, keeping
his eye upon the figures darting back and
forth upon the river. Betty, in a little red
hood, was bewitching. Sally Carteret was
the only other girl skater, and they had so
many cavaliers that it was difficult to have a
private word with any.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, Fortescue and his
friends had to take the steamboat which had
so frightened Kettle, on the greater river,
where the channel was kept open. The parting
with Betty was supposed to occur on the
river-bank, when Betty took the path to the
little brown house, and Fortescue went to
Rosehill to start for the landing. Fortescue
had time, however, to escort Betty to the edge
of the little lawn at Holly Lodge. They talked
of the merry, idle, pleasant nothings which
make up the staple of youth, until they
reached the edge of the lawn. The Colonel,
narrowly watching his one ewe lamb, saw only
Fortescue&rsquo;s low bow, his hat in his hand, and
knew nothing of the look in his eyes, and the
tender pressure of Betty&rsquo;s hand, and his
brief, significant words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if my leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>were not up; but I am a soldier, and a soldier
must obey orders. Promise that you won&rsquo;t
forget me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just at the hour that one week before
Betty had landed from the table in Fortescue&rsquo;s
arms, but in that time a new heaven and
a new earth had revealed themselves to both
of them. Betty was a constitutional and incurable
coquette, but deep in her heart she
was the soul of sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget you,&rdquo; she said softly, and
Fortescue, turning and walking rapidly back
to Rosehill, felt a profound satisfaction, a
delicious confidence, that was in itself happiness.
How faithful was Betty to the gallant
old Colonel! This reflection brought some
perplexities into Fortescue&rsquo;s mind, but he
dismissed them, as sturdy young soldiers of
twenty-five can throw out of doors unwelcome
guests in the guise of unwelcome thoughts.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">THE DREAM OF LOVE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Christmas festivities closed with a
bang, the visitors departed, and the county
settled down to dullness between the new
year and the springtime. Those of the young
people who could, went away to the cities for
the gay season. Betty Beverley was left very
much alone, but this she did not mind. Indeed,
it was rather a respite to her. Betty,
like all her kind, had a heart, and was brimming
over with emotions. Until that Christmas time,
her heart and her emotions had
been her sport, and she had gone upon her
cruel path distributing smiles and downcast
glances and pretty phrases impartially,
among many admirers. But the coquette
always comes to grief at last, and is throttled
when the great master passion awakes. Betty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>was still coquettish to all the world except
to Fortescue. It is true he had not asked
her outright to marry him, but Betty rather
liked the graduated steps toward the ultimate
heights of joy. Being a confident creature,
she had no doubt that Fortescue was
hers, but she was quite willing to put off the
time when the unseen bonds should become
the visible chain. For these Southern
coquettes develop naturally into devoted and
adoring wives, with no eyes for any man but
one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="350" height="179" alt="Church" title="" />
</div>

<p>There had been glorious winter weather up
to New Year, but within a week the January
storms set up, and for two months there was
sleet and snow. The small brown house was
shut in, and there was little passing back
and forth among the county people. The bad
weather kept Betty at home many Sundays
from the old Colonial church, with its venerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>rector. The Colonel&rsquo;s rheumatism
was much encouraged by the stormy season,
and he too was house-bound. In this time
of solitude, Betty lived in two worlds, one
the narrow walls of Holly Lodge, and the
other the great and splendid world of the
imagination, the Arcady of youth and love.
As she looked out of her dormer window
toward Rosehill, a mysterious smile shone
upon her speaking face as she saw herself
once more the mistress of the fine old house.
It is true there was an obstacle to be got over.
This was Fortescue&rsquo;s profession, because he
had told her how a soldier was sent hither
and yon. Betty was the last girl in the world
to ask a man to give up his profession, and,
most of all, the profession of arms, but youth
and inexperience can rearrange, in theory,
the pawns upon the chessboard of life.</p>

<p>Fortescue kept up an active siege. Every
week came flowers from him, or a book, or
a box of bonbons, something to remind Betty
of his existence. Constantly little white
notes were written by Betty, thanking him,
and with a word or two of deeper meaning.
Betty reckoned, as a certainty, that in the
spring Fortescue would return with the
officers who were to make the military survey.
There would be at least a dozen officers, so
Fortescue had told Betty, and they were to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>have a camp on the Colonel&rsquo;s land, only five
miles away, and although there would be
much work, there would also be a little play.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="484" height="250" alt="Garden Path" title="" />
</div>

<p>As Betty looked out of the window on the
wintry scene, she imagined it in the first
bloom of the early spring, the
leaden skies turned to a sapphire
blue, the frozen earth all
brown and green and odoriferous, the naked
branches of the trees and shrubs were
transformed into their first sweet budding,
and the silver river seemed dancing in
the sun. Betty was a busy little soul, and
had not much time for reverie, particularly
as she was hard at work on her summer
clothes, making dainty little muslin frocks
for herself, which she could do very well. But
there was a magic hour in her own little room
after she was ready for bed, when the candles
were out and only the scarlet and golden glory
of the firelight shone upon her. Then Betty,
in a smart little rose-colored dressing gown,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>which was the pride of her heart, would
huddle against the dormer window that
looked toward Rosehill, and think thoughts
and dream dreams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was, on the whole, a happy, though solitary
winter, and a very comfortable one to
others at Holly Lodge, besides Betty. The
comfort was to a great degree brought about
by Kettle. The boy not only picked up chips
and made the fires, and churned, and milked
the one cow, but was helpful at every turn to
Uncle Cesar and Aunt Tulip. The first thing
had been to provide him with some warm
clothes, and by the united efforts of Betty
and Aunt Tulip this had been accomplished.
Then, one bitter day, when there was nobody
to go for the mail to the village post-office,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>two miles away, Kettle, without saying a word
to anybody, slipped off. He knew that Betty,
whom he adored, was always looking for letters,
and Kettle, in his little heart, determined
that she should not look in vain that day.
He was missed, and Aunt Tulip resigned herself
to the belief that the boy had run away
again, carrying with him a much better outfit
than that with which he had arrived. But
Aunt Tulip&rsquo;s unjust suspicions were falsified
when in an hour or two Kettle turned up
again with the Colonel&rsquo;s weekly newspaper
and a letter and a large box of sweets for
Betty, from a source which she knew very
well. Aunt Tulip gave Kettle a wigging for
&ldquo;runnin&rsquo; off &rsquo;thout tellin&rsquo; nobody,&rdquo; but he
was merely admonished not to go again without
giving notice. The expedition, however,
turned out to be very profitable for Kettle,
as the keeper of the country store, who was
also the postmaster, had engaged Kettle in
conversation, and had ended by presenting
him with two shirts of a gaudy pink, and a
cap, which saved Kettle&rsquo;s one hat for Sundays.</p>

<p>Aunt Tulip was a pessimist on the subject
of boys, and was always expecting an outbreak
of depravity on Kettle&rsquo;s part. The
form in which this came was altogether unusual.
Kettle loved music, and whatever he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>might be doing, if he heard the strains of the
Colonel&rsquo;s violin, or especially Betty&rsquo;s touch
upon the harp in the sitting-room, it would
have been necessary to chain him up to keep
him away. He would sit on a little cricket in a
corner, his black, shiny eyes full of rapture,
and his mouth one vast grin. Kettle was in a
heaven of delight when the Colonel, of evenings,
tuned up his violin, and, sending for
Uncle Cesar, &ldquo;ole Marse&rdquo; and his &ldquo;boy&rdquo;
would make sweet, old-time music between
them. In a little while, however, Kettle began
to long that he too might call the soul of
music forth from the strings. On the rare
occasions when the Colonel was able to go out
for a walk, or when he was taking his afternoon
nap more soundly than usual, Kettle
would creep to the fiddle-case, and, opening it,
would let his little black hand wander among
the strings, and, bending his ear down, he
would listen as if it were the music of the
spheres. Uncle Cesar caught him at this one
day, and, seizing him by the collar, gave him
a shaking which made Kettle&rsquo;s teeth rattle.
Kettle shrieked, and Betty came running into
the kitchen, expecting to find a tragedy in
progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Uncle Cesar, &ldquo;this heah
impident little black nigger has been openin&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>ole Marse&rsquo; fiddle-box an&rsquo; mine, and pickin&rsquo; at
the strings, an&rsquo; I kinder believe he has been
a-pickin&rsquo; at the strings of your harp, Miss
Betty. Did you ever heah of such owdaciousness
sence Gord made you, Miss Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I never did,&rdquo; answered Betty
promptly. And then she said sternly, with
an accusing forefinger, to Kettle:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, Kettle, if ever I catch you
meddling with the harp or with the violin,
I will certainly give you a good switching,
myself. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yessum,&rdquo; answered Kettle, with solemn
emphasis.</p>

<p>This engagement was reinforced by Uncle
Cesar promising him an additional switching
in case he did not get his deserts in the first
one.</p>

<p>For a week or two, Kettle was able to keep
his fingers off the harp-strings and out of the
fiddle-box, but one morning, when the winter
sun was shining, and Colonel Beverley had
gone out for a little turn on the lawn, Kettle
fell from grace. Suspicious sounds were
heard in the sitting-room. Aunt Tulip softly
opened the door, and there was Kettle down
on his knees before the fiddle-case, picking
away in rapture. Aunt Tulip grabbed him,
and called wrathfully to Uncle Cesar to go
and get a switch. Uncle Cesar, full of vengeance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>went out and returned with what
might better be described as a sapling, it was
so long and stout. Just then Betty entered
the room, and Aunt Tulip told her of Kettle&rsquo;s
felonious acts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Aunt Tulip, you must give him
a whipping,&rdquo; said Betty positively.</p>

<p>The whole party then marched into the
kitchen, and Kettle was ordered to take off
his jacket, which he did with much natural
reluctance. Then, Aunt Tulip, flourishing the
long switch around, proceeded to harangue
Kettle indignantly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you &rsquo;shamed yourself, you good-for-nothin&rsquo;
little nigger, after all ole Marse
an&rsquo; Miss Betty done for you, ter sneak in the
settin&rsquo;-room, an&rsquo; be ruinin&rsquo; ole Marse&rsquo; fiddle-strings,
an&rsquo; meddlin&rsquo; with Miss Betty&rsquo;s
harp? I tell you what, boys has got ter git
switched sometimes, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a-gwine ter give
you a switchin&rsquo; this day you will remember
to the Day of Judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this awful preamble, Aunt Tulip
raised the switch, and Kettle, before a single
stroke had descended, burst into howls. Aunt
Tulip&rsquo;s hand faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declar, Miss Betty,&rdquo; she said apologetically,
pausing with the uplifted switch in the
air, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mighty hard ter give a switchin&rsquo;
ter a chile as ain&rsquo;t got no father nor mother;
but Kettle cert&rsquo;n&rsquo;y ought to have it, an&rsquo; I think
Cesar kin give it ter him better&rsquo;n I kin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this, the switch was handed over to
Uncle Cesar. Kettle redoubled his yells. The
prospect of the switch in Uncle Cesar&rsquo;s stalwart
arm was indeed terrifying. Uncle
Cesar, to make the ceremony more impressive,
took off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeves,
and lifted the switch on high. But
it did not come down on Kettle&rsquo;s back when
it was expected. Uncle Cesar&rsquo;s hand began to
tremble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty cur&rsquo;rus, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>Uncle Cesar, hesitating and rubbing his arm,
&ldquo;but I kinder got my hand out with switchin&rsquo;
boys, an&rsquo; the rheumatiz is right bad this
mornin&rsquo;. Anyhow, I reckon I better put off
this heah switchin&rsquo; &rsquo;twell the rheumatiz gits
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be put off, Uncle Cesar,&rdquo; answered
Betty decisively. &ldquo;The truth is, Aunt
Tulip and you are squarmish about giving
Kettle what he deserves. Now, I believe in
discipline, and if you promise a boy a switching,
you ought to give it to him. So give me
the switch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instrument of torture was duly handed
over to Betty. Kettle suddenly stopped his
wailings, and his mouth came wide open as
if it were on hinges. Betty, too, by way of
nerving herself for the task, began to give
Kettle a lecture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Kettle,&rdquo; she said sternly, &ldquo;your
conduct has been perfectly outrageous. You
were told not to touch my harp or the violins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, Miss Betty,&rdquo; whimpered Kettle,
his arm to his eyes, &ldquo;but them fiddles, they
jes&rsquo; seem a-callin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-callin&rsquo; ter me fur ter
come an&rsquo; play on &rsquo;em an&rsquo; that air harp&mdash;Miss
Betty, ef I could play a chune on one of them
fiddles, I&rsquo;d ruther do it&mdash;I&rsquo;d ruther do it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle&rsquo;s imagery failed him in finding a
simile strong enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were told not to touch them, and
you disobeyed. Now you are going to get a
whipping for it,&rdquo; replied Betty, catching her
under lip in her little white teeth, and raising
once more the five-foot and inch-thick switch.
When it had been lifted above him before,
Kettle had bawled loudly, but at the sight of
Betty standing on tiptoe with the switch
grasped in both hands, Kettle&rsquo;s open mouth
suddenly extended in a huge grin, and he
burst into a subdued guffaw. In vain, Betty
held the switch aloft and tried to screw up
courage to bring it down on Kettle. It was
quite impossible with Kettle grinning before
her and chuckling openly. Betty herself suddenly
burst out laughing, and dropped the
switch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing I can think of to do with
you, Kettle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is to teach you to
play the fiddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, Kettle&rsquo;s mouth, if possible, came
wider open than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, Miss Betty!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;does you
mean you is a-gwine to put the bow in my
han&rsquo; and lemme scrape them strings with
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; answered Betty. &ldquo;I will
teach you your notes, and Uncle Cesar will
show you how to handle the bow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day began Kettle&rsquo;s musical edu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>cation.
The Colonel sitting in his great chair,
would smile at Betty with the music-book, instructing
Kettle in the notes which she knew.
Kettle was extremely stupid at learning his
notes, and Betty frequently promised him the
long delayed switching for his negligence.
But as soon as Uncle Cesar took charge of
him and put the bow in his hand, Kettle
learned with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, my dear,&rdquo; the Colonel would
say to Betty on these occasions, &ldquo;that Kettle
can master the concrete better than the abstract.
However, he must learn his notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle progressed so fast that in the course
of a couple of months he enjoyed the privilege
of playing a second to the Colonel&rsquo;s fiddle.
The boy&rsquo;s arms were barely long enough to
use a grown-up fiddle. As he played, he
shuffled about in rapture, and Betty taught
him to do the back-step and double shuffle
while he played. It was a new amusement in
the Colonel&rsquo;s quiet life to have Kettle come
in the sitting-room in the evening after supper,
and play and dance for him, while Kettle
enjoyed the performance beyond words.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">IT WAS THE SPRINGTIME</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> winter slipped away, and in April
the little camp was to be formed, and the
officers were to remain for a couple of
months. The thought of seeing Fortescue
again, brought the eloquent blood to Betty&rsquo;s
delicate cheeks and a new brilliance to her
sparkling eyes. The spring came early in
that latitude, and the first day of April was
deliciously mild. Betty was at work in the
little old-fashioned garden of Holly Lodge.
She had brought with her from Rosehill many
rosebushes and a bed of cowslips and violets.
With a garden trowel in her hand, her skirts
pinned up, and a red Tam o&rsquo;Shanter pushed
back from her forehead, Betty was busy digging
about the rosebushes. Kettle had been
of the greatest service in making the garden.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>That morning he had been sent to the post-office
for the mail, and Betty was watching
out for him: he was likely to bring her a letter
from Fortescue. Presently, Kettle appeared
crossing the little lawn, and passed through
the garden gate. His shrewd little mind had
discovered that when he delivered to Betty
a large, square envelope, addressed in a certain
masculine handwriting, Betty was sure
to smile and open the letter quickly. This
happened again, but Kettle was amazed to
see Betty&rsquo;s dimple suddenly disappear, her
bright eyes suddenly grow sombre, and the
color drop swiftly out of her cheeks. She
read the letter through slowly, and then stood
with her eyes fixed upon the ground and her
lips trembling. Fortescue was not coming
with the other officers. He had just received
orders to the other side of the continent. He
had asked for twenty-four hours&rsquo; leave, which
would give him a chance to see Betty for
about two hours the next day. He did not
know, however, whether he could get permission
in time to make the boat or not, but he
would do it if mortal man could. He hoped
Betty would understand why he came. The
girl knew well enough what he meant, but the
thought of three thousand miles between them
for a long time, brought its pang. The fair
day suddenly lost its beauty for Betty. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>vagrant breeze seemed to sigh farewell, and
the sapphire sky above her would not be long
the sky above Fortescue. She was roused
from her painful dream by Kettle&rsquo;s voice,
and realized that the boy had stood motionless
next her for a long time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="250" height="321" alt="Hedge" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great deal is the matter with me,&rdquo;
sighed Betty, putting the letter in her pocket,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>and resuming her digging and trimming.
What did it matter whether the roses bloomed
that June or not? And the violets and the
cowslips could not console her for Fortescue.</p>

<p>Betty remained a long time in the garden
that morning. Kettle followed her about like
a dog, every now and then asking anxiously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, don&rsquo;t you feel no better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of her sadness and disappointment,
Betty was roused out of herself by Kettle&rsquo;s
sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel any better now, Kettle,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Perhaps I shall to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But although Betty might show her chagrin
and despondency before Kettle and the rosebushes
and the violets and the cowslips, she
had no intention whatever of letting anybody
else see it. When she looked up and saw the
Colonel coming out to take the air, pacing up
and down the garden walk in the sunny spring
day, Betty, who was a clever actress, put on
her most smiling aspect. As the Colonel
limped up and down for half an hour, his arm
on Betty&rsquo;s shoulder, he thought he had never
known her more cheerful. She told him quite
naturally that she had had a letter from Mr.
Fortescue, and that he was ordered to the
Northwest, but, if possible, he would be at
Rosehill the next day for a short time, and
would come over to see them. The Colonel&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>emotions concerning Fortescue were very
badly mixed and perplexing even to himself.
He was not so selfish as to forget Betty&rsquo;s happiness,
and Fortescue was a fine, upstanding
young fellow, quite after the Colonel&rsquo;s heart.
But there was something calculated to daunt
the brave soul of the old man in the thought
of his few remaining years without Betty. He
had been called upon to resign the love of his
youth, his only son, and Rosehill, and now
this little one&mdash;&mdash; At the thought, the
Colonel said to himself, as he had done many
times in years past, amid the hail of bullets,
with cannon thundering in his ears, or in
snow and sleet and starvation, &ldquo;Courage!
Courage!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>All that day, Betty was in a dream. She
knew very well the answer she would give
Fortescue, but suddenly she looked into the
stern face of Life, and saw what those dreams
meant. How could she leave Holly Lodge
and the Colonel and Aunt Tulip and Uncle
Cesar and Kettle, and the young chickens,
just hatched? Life was a practical affair with
Betty, but, alas, sentiment and emotion were
strong within her. She did not know how the
next twenty-four hours passed, except that
her eyes continually swept the narrow lane
that led to the little gate of Holly Lodge. She
would rather see Fortescue in the garden,
and therefore dressed herself in her little
pale yellow gown, and put on a great straw
hat, trimmed with little yellow buds and green
leaves, that was worthy of a dryad. The
air was warm and soft at midday, and Betty
was walking up and down the garden path,
watching, watching, watching, and at last,
just as she had turned her back to the gate
and was walking the length of the little garden
path, Fortescue was at her side. He looked
so bronzed, so soldierly, so much the man, that
Betty gave a little gasp of delight. There
was a tall box-hedge in the little old garden
which screened the walk from the windows of
the house, so that Fortescue could take
Betty&rsquo;s hand and be unseen as they walked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>up and down in the pleasant spring noon.
Then Fortescue told her all: that he had received
his unexpected orders and must go,
that it wrung his heart to leave her, but that
he was hers forever, and that though his body
might be in the far Northwest, his heart and
soul would be at Holly Lodge. Betty&rsquo;s eyes
made answer to Fortescue, and her lips spoke
the winged words that gave her to her lover.
A pair of robins beginning housekeeping in
the grape arbor at the end of the walk sang
and trilled rapturously as they watched the
lovers.</p>

<p class="center">&#160;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="i_124"><img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="400" height="579" alt="&ldquo;BUT IF YOU LOVE ME&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;" title="" /></a>

<p class="center2 no-indent">&ldquo;BUT IF YOU LOVE ME&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="center">&#160;</p>

<p>There could be no question of their being
married immediately, as Fortescue would be
on the wing for the next four months, and he
knew nothing of his new station or duties,
except that both were trying and the conditions
unsuited to a woman. But later, after
he had seen what the conditions were, perhaps
he could take Betty with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am asking a great deal of you, Betty,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;The wife of a junior officer has to
go from place to place, to be uprooted constantly.
It is true that I am lucky in having
money enough to make it as easy as it can be
made, still, it is hard, hard, all the same. But
if you love me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty said one little word which settled
that point, though her eyes were grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I leave my grandfather?&rdquo; she
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not leave him,&rdquo; promptly replied
Fortescue. &ldquo;We can carry the old gentleman
and the whole outfit around with us.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/i_108.jpg" width="484" height="250" alt="Garden Path" title="" /></div>

<p>But Betty shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my grandfather,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;He has a very independent spirit.
How could a man who has lived his life here
for so many years go from place to place? He
must live and die here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can go and live at Rosehill if he wants
to,&rdquo; answered Fortescue, who was disposed
to brush away all obstacles. &ldquo;My father is
pretty good to me, and he will do anything
I ask him about the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Granddaddy would never consent to
be a pensioner on anybody, I am sure,&rdquo; continued
Betty, with a doleful little smile. &ldquo;So
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>we can&rsquo;t be married until you are retired,
thirty-six years from now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue scouted this proposition, but he
saw in Betty Beverley something that gave
him pain and yet made him proud. This was
a fixed loyalty to her duty. It was that which
made Fortescue, who could have led a life of
idle luxury, lead the stern life of a soldier.
He would not have loved Betty half so well
if she had shown too much willingness to cast
off the old ties for the new. But, as Fortescue
told himself and Betty, there are a great many
troublesome questions coming up all the time
concerning human beings, horses, cows, gardens,
and everything else. There was one
small scrap of comfort. It was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the only thing is, Betty,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that we shall love each other and stand by
each other, and some way out of it will be
found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was possible that in December, when
the great Northwest was snow-bound, Fortescue
might get a month&rsquo;s leave. If he came to
Virginia and back, it would give him a week,
perhaps ten days, at Rosehill. Of course, he
would have to spend a day or two with his
father and brothers but they could meet him
somewhere on the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a fine old dad,&rdquo; Fortescue said,
&ldquo;and he is always saying that the men of to-day
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>have no devotion to women; so the old
gentleman wouldn&rsquo;t think me game if I didn&rsquo;t
spend most of my leave with you, eh, Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to them but a little space of time
that they had been in the garden together,
when Fortescue, suddenly looking at his
watch, found that he had barely time to go
into the house and speak to the Colonel and
then catch the boat at the landing. The
friendly hedge that had screened the lovers
witnessed the last throbbing kiss. Outwardly
serene, but inwardly palpitating, they went
quickly into the house. Betty had warned
Fortescue, as they ran down the garden path,
to say nothing to her grandfather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will only distress him and keep him
awake at night, and I will choose a time to
tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Fortescue. &ldquo;Just
give me notice, and I will write him the conventional
letter. But to tell you the truth,
Betty, I would just as soon be out of the way
when the Colonel turns those pathetic eyes
on you, as you talk about getting married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Beverley had seen so many young
men walking up and down the garden path
with Betty, and had watched the rise and fall
of so many flirtations, that he attached little
consequence to Fortescue&rsquo;s visit. He was
sorry that the young officer would not be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>among the party in the camp, and added with
a grim smile that no doubt the young ladies
in the county would miss him extremely and
would be forced to take comfort in other
second lieutenants, just as it had been in his
day. Then with best wishes and a handshake,
and a soft pressure of Betty&rsquo;s fingers,
Fortescue was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine, personable youngster,&rdquo; said the
Colonel to Betty. &ldquo;Very creditable of him,
serving in the army, and he the son of a rich
man. He could be, if he wished, of the idle
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were an idle rich man, I don&rsquo;t think
I should care much about him,&rdquo; said Betty
significantly.</p>

<span class="chap_name no-indent">PROBLEMS</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> to that point, life had been the simplest
of propositions to Betty Beverley, but from
that day it became painfully complex. She
had thought but little and spoken less of the
great word &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; but she had in her the
soul of the soldier, and her duty loomed large
before her, as it did before Fortescue. On
this point their understanding was perfect.
Betty, if Fortescue had been ordered into
action, would have buckled his sword about
his waist and bade him, with a smile, to go.
In the same way, when Betty spoke of her
duty to stay, Fortescue said no word to make
her a traitor. But they were both young and
full of hope and love, and had transcendent
confidence in the future. Everything would
come right, was the easy conviction of both.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>
<p>Betty waited a few days to see if Fortescue&rsquo;s
visit had roused any latent suspicions
in the Colonel&rsquo;s mind, but, seeing it had not,
one day when it was soft and mild as on the
day of days when Fortescue had told her of
his love, she walked in the little garden with
the Colonel and told him all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mean to desert you, granddaddy,&rdquo;
she said firmly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how
it is coming out, and neither does Jack&rdquo;&mdash;for
by that time Fortescue had become
&ldquo;Jack&rdquo; to Betty&mdash;&ldquo;but I hate a deserter, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be desertion, my dear,&rdquo; said
the Colonel. &ldquo;And it would be a base thing
of me to spoil your life, my little Betty. But,
as you say, a way will be found. Don&rsquo;t let us
trouble about it until Christmas, then, as you
say, Fortescue will try to get a leave that will
give him a week at Rosehill, and we shall see.
I think perhaps I could get on pretty well at
Holly Lodge with Cesar and Tulip and
Kettle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; cried Betty indignantly,
&ldquo;that you could get on pretty well without
me? Oh, what a wicked old grandfather you
are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you will come to see me sometimes,&rdquo;
said the Colonel, anxious to find a
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>In due time the letter to the Colonel came
from Fortescue, and the Colonel answered it
in his dignified, old-fashioned manner. He
did not wish and would not permit himself
to be a bar to his granddaughter&rsquo;s happiness.
After a time, when their affection had been
tested, he would give his consent to the
marriage.</p>

<p>The officers came, and the camp was
pitched, and much work was done. Likewise,
much eating, drinking, dancing, riding, boating,
and picnicing with the county people.
It was the old story of Christmas week transferred
to spring. Betty appeared to be as
keen over the lieutenants as Sally Carteret
or any girl in the county, nor did she feel any
qualms of conscience when two second lieutenants
each told her at different times that he
could not live without her. Betty was a little
unfeeling toward her admirers, and her tears
were but crocodile tears when she told the
lieutenants that she could not leave her grandfather&mdash;except
for that&mdash;&mdash; Here Betty
broke down prettily, and the lieutenants were
in despair. But they speedily recovered from
their disappointment and found other outlets
for their affections. Betty, the trifler, was
serious enough, however, where Fortescue
was concerned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

</div>

<p>The spring melted into summer and on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>day black for Sally Carteret and the other
gay young things in the county the camp was
broken and the officers departed. Luckily,
though, it was at the season when the University
students returned to the county, bringing
many of their fellow students with them, so
that there was balm in Gilead. As for Betty,
she was quite willing to play with the University
students, as she had with the second
lieutenants. But deep down in her heart they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>mattered little. There was only one man for
her, and that was Lieutenant John Hope Fortescue.</p>

<p>The earth seemed brightening for all at
Holly Lodge. The Colonel had learned more
and more to accommodate himself to the little
house and the simple surroundings, and, free
from debts and duns, had great peace. Betty,
whose heart had flown about like the larks
and thrushes from bough to bough, had at last
made its nest, and she too had great peace.
Kettle turned out to be not only a solid addition
to their comfort, but almost to their happiness.
His sturdy little bow-legs waddled
about, bringing wood and water, and doing
errands. He was always cheery and helpful,
but with the faults which are necessary to the
typical boy. He would occasionally neglect
his work for the sake of his adored fiddle, and
when sent down to the river shore to catch
crabs for dinner would become so absorbed
in the sport that he would forget that it was
merely a means to an end. One day, however,
he incurred the wrath of the whole establishment
at Holly Lodge. Among Betty&rsquo;s treasures
was a great tall glass bottle of attar of
roses, of which a single drop perfumed a
room. Kettle, passing Betty&rsquo;s open door,
the room being empty, saw on the dressing
table the beautiful bottle in which was stored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>the perfume he loved. The devil tempted
him, and Kettle yielded. He slipped into the
room, and, opening the bottle, rubbed its contents,
a gill or two of attar of rose, into his
wool.</p>

<p>Downstairs, a pungent odor, so strong that
it was almost asphyxiating, penetrated, and
as Kettle&rsquo;s steps were heard approaching the
perfume became overpowering. The Colonel
began to sneeze, and even Aunt Tulip and
Uncle Cesar in the kitchen had to run out into
the open air. Betty, with her handkerchief
to her face, rushed into the little hall, where
Kettle stood, his eyes bulging out of his head,
as he too gasped and sneezed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve upset my attar of rose upon your
head!&rdquo; screamed Betty. &ldquo;Go out of doors
this minute, and I&rsquo;ll hand you over to Uncle
Cesar for a real switching this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time Aunt Tulip had dashed in from
the kitchen, and, seizing Kettle by his woolly
head, dragged him out of doors to the pump,
calling meanwhile for Uncle Cesar, working
in the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cesar! You Cesar! Come heah right
away, an&rsquo; bring my big scissors. This heah
wuffless little black nigger done tooken all
Miss Betty&rsquo;s attar of rose an&rsquo; done rub it into
he haid, an&rsquo; arter you git the scissors, cut a
switch an&rsquo; give him a good tunin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>This terrifying prospect entirely upset
Kettle&rsquo;s moral balance, and he began to protest,
spluttering and stuttering, as Aunt Tulip
pumped water vigorously on his offending
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;clar ter goodness, I ain&rsquo; never see Miss
Betty&rsquo;s attar of rose. I ain&rsquo; never tetch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, Aunt Tulip stopped pumping on
Kettle long enough to shake him violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does you know where liars go?&rdquo; cried
Aunt Tulip indignantly. &ldquo;Doan&rsquo; you know
nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout the lake burnin&rsquo; wid fire an&rsquo;
brimstone, an&rsquo; the devil stan&rsquo;in&rsquo; by wid a red
hot pitchfork, stickin&rsquo; it into dem sinners?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This awful future, the arrival of Uncle
Cesar with the scissors, Aunt Tulip&rsquo;s merciless
use of them on his wool, and Uncle
Cesar&rsquo;s going off after a switch, brought
shrieks from Kettle, as if he were being murdered
by inches. Betty, in the house, hearing
Kettle&rsquo;s screams, ran out, and Uncle Cesar
reappeared at the same moment with a switch
of horrifying proportions. Poor Kettle, with
every scrap of wool cut off his head, leaving
his skull as bare as an egg, was so drenched
and frightened and woebegone, that Betty&rsquo;s
heart melted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Uncle Cesar,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t
give Kettle that switching to-day, though he
certainly deserves it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Cesar was loth to lay aside the instrument
of torture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, you better lemme give him a
dozen licks anyhow,&rdquo; urged Uncle Cesar.
&ldquo;You k&rsquo;yarn&rsquo; raise boys &rsquo;thout licks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Betty demurred. Kettle, meanwhile,
poured out a flood of penitential tears, and,
moved by Betty&rsquo;s clemency, confessed that
he had emptied the bottle of attar of rose on
his head and rubbed it in. He even offered
to produce the empty bottle to corroborate
his word, which nobody doubted. However,
the oft-deferred switching was once more
postponed, and the improved prospects raised
Kettle&rsquo;s spirits immediately. Half an hour
afterward, when he was in dry clothes, he
was as cheerful as ever, although minus his
wool, and, having been sent to the wood-pile
by the still indignant Aunt Tulip, was seen
standing on his head in the intervals of picking
up chips.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">THE BROKEN DREAM</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the sunny autumn succeeded the enchanted
summer, it seemed to Betty as if a
new and lovely light were over the world. Fortescue&rsquo;s
letters, his constant gifts, the books
which came often, and the music he sent her,
and which Betty played and sang to her harp,
were so many messages of love. Fortescue
wrote that he had applied for leave, and that
by making close connections he would be able
to spend ten whole days at Rosehill. He meant
to give a ball on Christmas Eve at Rosehill,
and, as he wrote Betty, she could practise
her future rle as mistress of Rosehill.
Fortescue could not manage the ball as well
as the county people managed their Christmas
balls. All he could do was to order the
music and the supper and everything from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>Baltimore, but when Betty presided at Rosehill
things could be done better and in true
Virginia style. He hoped to arrive some days
before Christmas.</p>

<p>Then Betty began the pleasant process of
counting the days. This she confided to the
Colonel, for Betty understood, as few young
things do, the yearning of the old for the confidence
of the young, the delicacy felt by an
old man lest he intrude upon the secrets of
the young.</p>

<p>The two, Betty and the Colonel, tried very
hard to dovetail the wishes and duties and interests
of the triangle. Fortescue was the
third angle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way,&rdquo; Betty cried, when they had
reasoned out that she could not desert the
Colonel, nor could she refuse to marry her
lover, nor could Fortescue abandon his profession,
nor could Betty abandon the idea of
presiding at Rosehill&mdash;&ldquo;Any way, Granddaddy,
it will only be thirty-five years now
before Jack is retired, and then we can all
three settle down at Rosehill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The preparations for Christmas gaieties
began early, and the same round of dances
and hunts and dinners and teas and festivities
of all sorts was arranged.</p>

<p>It was the third day before Christmas, and
Betty, with her skirts pinned up, her sleeves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>turned back to her elbows, and a red silk
handkerchief of the Colonel&rsquo;s tied around her
head, was preparing the icing for the Christmas
cake, when she saw Fortescue passing
the window. There was no time to escape.
The next minute he was in the little sitting-room,
and Betty was clasped to his heart.
After the first rapture of meeting, Betty made
numerous apologies, unpinned her skirts,
pulled down her sleeves, and removed the
handkerchief from her shining hair, but Fortescue
told her she did not look half so pretty
as before. It was a happy hour, one of those
little glimpses of the Elysian fields of the soul
which come only to the young and the pure.
Luckily, the Colonel was taking his afternoon
stroll supported by his stick, and with Kettle
as aide-de-camp in attendance. The lovers
had a full hour to themselves in the violet
dusk, the room only lighted by the wood fire
and the pale glow of the wintry sunset. Presently,
the Colonel came in and shook hands
cordially with Fortescue. It was the hour
when Betty sang to her harp the old songs
the Colonel loved. Fortescue thought he had
never seen so sweet a picture as Betty playing
and singing to the harp, while the Colonel,
leaning forward on his stick, listened with
his soul in his eyes. Kettle, squatting tailor-fashion
on the hearth, fixed his round eyes on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>Betty, and his little woolly black head was
motionless while she was singing.</p>

<p>Of course Fortescue stayed to supper, and
Uncle Cesar was reinforced by Kettle, who
was chief batter-cake server, and brought
from the kitchen the numerous relays of hot
batter-cakes, hot waffles, and hot biscuits of
which the well known Virginia formula is,
&ldquo;Take two and butter them while they are
hot.&rdquo; Afterward, when Kettle had had his
supper, he was sent for to exhibit his accomplishments
with the fiddle. Kettle played
dances and sang simultaneously, his merry
music delighting Fortescue, whose musical
education was not above rag-time. Fortescue
told about the arrangements he had made
for the Christmas Eve ball at Rosehill, and
Betty thought them ineffably grand.</p>

<p>When Kettle had been sent away, there was
much talk about armies and soldiers between
Fortescue and the Colonel, whose heart was
ever with the fighting men. Betty listened
with delight to this modern Froissart&rsquo;s
Chronicle, and said presently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How glad I am to be a soldier&rsquo;s
daughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why you will make a glorious
wife for a soldier,&rdquo; replied Fortescue impudently,
at which Betty blushed all over her
face and neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Holly Lodge" title="" />
</div>

<p>When Fortescue was walking back to Rosehill,
he saw over his shoulder the lights shining
from Betty&rsquo;s dormer windows. He went
direct to his own room as soon as he reached
Rosehill, and after a while saw the lights go
out in Betty&rsquo;s windows. Fortescue, who, like
most soldiers, believed in God and respected
Him as the Great Commander, knew that
Betty was saying her simple, earnest prayers
for him, and the thought that the prayers of
the innocent were heard gave him a reverent
thankfulness. To Betty, in her little white
bed in the darkened room, with the curtain
drawn wide so that she could watch the lights
at Rosehill as long as they burned, it was as
if the world were growing too beautiful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>Deep in her heart was the old Greek superstition
that one cannot walk the airy heights
of happiness long without a precipice opening
beneath one&rsquo;s feet. The thought oppressed
her and kept her awake long after the
windows of Rosehill were dark. Something
like a presentiment stole into her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever happens, though,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;nothing can come between Jack and me. We
understand each other too well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the melancholy cry of a nightbird
resounded outside in the darkness. It was
strange to hear that cry at midnight in the
dead of winter and it made Betty shiver.</p>

<p>The next day the gaieties began with great
vigor. The county was full of visitors, and
the whirl of dancing feet was everywhere.</p>

<p>Early the next day, Fortescue came over
to Holly Lodge. He sat awhile in the sitting-room,
talking pleasantly to the Colonel,
who, in the old days before the continent was
linked by railways, had travelled through the
far-off country beyond the Rocky Mountains.
Betty was congratulating herself upon the
extreme good fortune that Fortescue and her
grandfather had so much in common. But
even that brought a little chill to her heart,
for blessings have their price, and Betty was
superstitious.</p>

<p>The morning was cold and clear, and after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>awhile Fortescue asked Betty to come out for
a turn with him. Betty went willingly
enough. The Colonel watched the two as
they started off up the lane toward the belt of
woodland that skirted the highway. Betty&rsquo;s
trim figure in black, with a little black hat on
her shapely head, just came up to Fortescue&rsquo;s
shoulder. They were a good height, and
walked well together, thought the Colonel,
used to watching marchers.</p>

<p>Of course Betty and Fortescue had everything
to tell each other, in spite of the long
letters which had been exchanged weekly.
But when they were once in the woodland,
with the morning sun shining upon the tall
and scattered cedars, Fortescue threw everything
aside for the chief purpose he had in
view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Betty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come here
to have you fix the day when we shall be married.
I don&rsquo;t believe in long engagements,
and never meant to have one. My special
duty will end in the spring, and then we must
be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes grew troubled. What should
she say? How could she leave the Colonel?
Something like this she stammered out. Fortescue
met it impatiently. He believed in her
doing her duty by the Colonel, but, man-like,
he thought that Betty must do her duty by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>him first. There was no question of money.
Fortescue had enough to do as he pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make the Colonel comfortable any way
you like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let him stay at Holly
Lodge or go to Rosehill. My father has given
me the place, and some day, when I am a retired
major-general, Betty, we shall live there,
you and I and our children. But we must
come to a positive arrangement now.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>Fortescue&rsquo;s tone displeased Betty. He was
too confident, too much in the way of giving
orders, a thing which Betty herself was accustomed
to doing. It cannot be denied that
Betty was a little spoiled and rather haughty.
Her reply to Fortescue displeased him even
more than his words had displeased her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;that you are
taking too much for granted. Some one must
be considered as well as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a most unlucky speech. Fortescue&rsquo;s
reply was a retaliation. They were
only twenty-one and twenty-six, and although
they had far more of feeling, strength, depth,
and steadiness of character than young persons
usually have, they were no wiser or more
experienced than most young things. Some
words followed, impetuous and domineering
on Fortescue&rsquo;s part, exasperatingly cool on
Betty&rsquo;s. They were both keen of wit, and
readily surmised the meaning of sharp
phrases. Fortescue&rsquo;s feelings were quick,
and Betty had a tidy little temper of her own.
Suddenly, they knew not how or when or why,
but they were walking back toward Holly
Lodge in the crisp winter morning, each with
a resentful heart. Their first meeting as
confessed sweethearts had developed into a
serious quarrel. It was not about those
trifling things that arise between young
lovers, and which bring tears and reproaches,
and then end in forgiveness, but it concerned
a grave matter, the regulation of their future
lives and their mutual obligations, one to the
other. The question of what was to become
of the Colonel had seemed so easy to settle
when they had considered it on the far-off
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>horizon. Now, when it came close to them, it
assumed a dangerous aspect. The rash and
inexperienced Betty thought that it must be
settled according to her ideas, and that Fortescue
must wait until the Colonel was coaxed
into saying what he would do in the premises.
Fortescue, with a much better idea of the
vicissitudes of an officer&rsquo;s life, saw that
Betty&rsquo;s plans and compromises and dovetailings
of duty were impracticable, and told
her so. The bitterest quarrels on earth are
those between a man and a woman who love
each other, and whose anger &ldquo;doth work like
madness in the brain.&rdquo; It was the more intense
because each felt to be in the right, and
that the other must yield in the name of love
and duty. But yielding was new and strange
to each. Betty knew so little of the power of
money that she resented Fortescue&rsquo;s bringing
that into the discussion, and, moreover, she
was an arrogant little creature and a trifle too
ready for a fight. Fortescue, who had seen
the great outside world unknown to Betty,
knew the Spanish proverb, &ldquo;God is the general,
but money is His lieutenant.&rdquo; It took
all of Betty&rsquo;s self-command to hold back the
tears and to keep her lips from trembling.
If those tears had dropped upon her cheeks
and her lovely mouth had quivered, all would
have been well, but Fortescue, watching her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>sidewise, saw only her head in the air, her
delicate face as firm as marble, and said to
himself savagely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t care, why should I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All at once, a horrid doubt of Betty took
possession of his mind. Once, he had laughed
at her outrageous flattery of other men, her
open cajolery, her pretty coquetries. Suppose,
after all, she had no feeling, and was
making sport of his honest heart? Perhaps
she had never meant to marry him, and was
only amusing herself. There might be
another man&mdash;at this, Fortescue ground his
teeth.</p>

<p>They walked the whole length of the lane
without speaking. When they got to the
paling surrounding the little lawn of Holly
Lodge, Betty spoke, but her evil genius waited
upon her tongue that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as we can&rsquo;t agree,
everything is over. But if we appear unfriendly,
everybody will notice it, and I do
so hate to have people gabbling about me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; promptly assented Fortescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;we must be as
friendly as ever while you are in the county.
Luckily, nobody knows anything, except
Grandfather, and he will, of course, keep
quiet. People here don&rsquo;t think as much of
a man&rsquo;s attentions to a girl as you do, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>other men have danced with me quite as much
as you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; replied Fortescue sharply.
&ldquo;I think you were simply amusing yourself
all the time. Well, then, I can play that game
all right. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was off, and Betty was walking soberly
into the house. The fair day had grown dark,
and her heart in her breast was like a stone.
Woman-like, she began to defend herself
against herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is so dictatorial as all that, we never
could have got on, so perhaps it is the best
thing that we found it out immediately. If a
woman gives in at once to a man and never
remembers what is due anybody else, she
might as well be a slave!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">PRIDE PAYS THE PRICE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Colonel was playing on his violin as
Betty entered the sitting-room, and what he
had chosen was the sad old air of &ldquo;Love Not,
Love Not, Ye Hapless Sons of Men.&rdquo; He
laid down his violin, and noticed that Betty&rsquo;s
face was pale, in spite of the sharp winter
air, and that she spoke with suppressed fury
in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is all over
between Mr. Fortescue and me. Please don&rsquo;t
ask me about it. We didn&rsquo;t disagree about a
trifle, but about something important. We
are perfectly friendly, and mean to keep so,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>because we don&rsquo;t want the people in the
county talking about us and worrying us with
questions. But it is all over, quite over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel started and studied Betty
closely. He knew the resolute character, the
stubborn pride, that lay beneath all of Betty&rsquo;s
frivolities. She could do things as foolish as
any girl of her age, but she could suffer more
than most. The Colonel sighed as he looked
at her pale, unsmiling face, her eyes full of
angry light. He understood the sharp pain
of those who have not learned the awful
lesson of life, the haughty attitude of the
young who have never known defeat, the sufferings
of mortified pride and wounded
vanity, and, above all, he had an inward conviction
that Betty in her heart loved Fortescue.
Man-like, the Colonel was not so sure
of Fortescue, and a resentment, grim and
stern, rose within him. Until the young
officer appeared, Betty had been quite happy
and satisfied at Holly Lodge. In time, she
would have married some one in the county
perhaps, and would have led that peaceful
life on the sunny side of the wall, which only
the quiet lives know. But with Fortescue&rsquo;s
appearance had come the disturbing vision
of a possible return to Rosehill, of a life in
the great outside world, going from place to
place, of the breaking of all the old ties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>Betty had asked him not to question her, but
the Colonel felt justified in asking precisely
one question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, has Mr. Fortescue acted dishonorably?&rdquo;
he inquired, straightening up
his old figure, still soldierly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Betty promptly. &ldquo;Mr.
Fortescue couldn&rsquo;t do anything dishonorable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; answered the Colonel
grimly. &ldquo;If he had, I should have felt
called upon to chastise him according to the
code in which I was reared and have lived and
shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s heart was quivering, her pride was
up in arms, the whole world seemed full of
tears; but when the Colonel talked about
chastising Fortescue&rsquo;s young strength, her
sense of humor overwhelmed her pain, and
she suddenly laughed a little. She did not
tell the Colonel the cause of her ripple of
laughter, and in another minute her eyes grew
sombre and her heart once more hardened
against Fortescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be quite satisfied, Grandfather,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;All that has happened
was my own act.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="300" height="340" alt="Dresser and Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>Betty turned and went out of the room.
Being Christmas time, and there being no
household tasks awaiting her, no sewing to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>do, because she had planned that this Christmas time
should be one of perfect leisure,
that she might be free to entertain her great
guest, First Love, there was nothing for her
to do. She went aimlessly up to her room.
Then, suddenly, she felt a sharp headache.
Her mental suffering produced a physical
pain. She was rather glad of it, as it gave her
an excuse for keeping to her room and lying
down. The little room was flooded with
winter sunshine, and a pretty fire was smouldering
on the hearth. Betty drew the curtains,
glancing meanwhile toward Rosehill. Her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>keen eyes caught sight of Fortescue crossing
the lawn rapidly. A great buzzard was
wheeling majestically over the Rosehill
house, and a group of the servants, one of the
men with a gun, was standing on the edge of
the lawn, prepared to fire at the bird. Fortescue
walked up and, taking the gun, sighted
and fired, and the buzzard fell upon the roof
of the house. This little act wrung Betty&rsquo;s
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little he cares!&rdquo; she thought bitterly.
&ldquo;Any trifle can distract him. Well,
it was better to find it out in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, Betty turned her
eyes away as the Colonel turned his away
from Rosehill. She loved the place, and deep
in her heart had grown the wish to preside
there once more, as Fortescue&rsquo;s wife. It was
impossible, quite impossible, now. She could
not forget Fortescue&mdash;Betty was honest
enough with herself to know that, and honorable
enough to respect her own affection.
Love is not killed in an hour or even a day.
The great stretch of life ahead of her loomed
before Betty&rsquo;s eyes as one stands on the edge
of a parched desert and thinks of the weary
journey across it. For Betty Beverley, the
coquette, was the soul of constancy. These
thoughts and many others and a racking
headache drove Betty to her bed. She threw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>herself on it, with all the sunshine shut out of
her room, just as it had been shut suddenly
out of her life.</p>

<p>At the midday dinner, Kettle, who had
almost supplanted Uncle Cesar as butler,
came up, and, opening Betty&rsquo;s door and putting
in his little woolly head, said softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, dinner done ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t come down to dinner,&rdquo; answered
Betty. &ldquo;Tell the Colonel that I have a bad
headache. It will be better to-night, and I am
going to the party just the same. But when
dinner is over, Kettle, you may bring me up
some tea and toast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle had never known Betty to have an
ache or a pain since he had been established
at Holly Lodge, and the sight of her pale face,
and the weariness in her voice, frightened
him. He began to argue with Betty:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, you better come down ter
dinner. Aunt Tulip, she done cook some of
the bes&rsquo; sweet &rsquo;taters you ever see in your
life, Miss Betty&mdash;got sugar on &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;
butter too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for any, thank you,&rdquo; said
Betty, her heart far away from sweet potatoes
with sugar and butter.</p>

<p>Kettle paused for a minute in order to think
of some other inducement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Tulip, she got a rice pudden&rsquo; wid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>gre&rsquo;t big raisins in it, mos&rsquo; as big as my fist,&rdquo;
urged Kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; replied Betty absently.</p>

<p>But Kettle&rsquo;s sympathy could not be bottled
up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty,&rdquo; pleaded Kettle, &ldquo;lemme
go out an&rsquo; crack you up some wun&rsquo;nuts,&rdquo; by
which Kettle meant walnuts.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s patience was giving out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Kettle,&rdquo; she said sharply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want anything except tea and toast, as I told
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Betty,&rdquo; persisted Kettle, edging
toward the door, &ldquo;I got a big bag o&rsquo;
chestnuts, an&rsquo; they mighty good roasted on
the kitchen shovel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s nerves and her temper could stand
no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away, Kettle,&rdquo; she cried impatiently.
&ldquo;Go downstairs this minute and serve the
Colonel&rsquo;s soup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone could not be mistaken, and Kettle
went out of the door as if shot out of a gun.
Once outside, however, his little faithful heart
was still torn for Betty, and he was prepared
to take great risks. He turned the door-knob
noiselessly, and, putting his round, black head
in the door, whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, Miss Betty, when I bring up
yo&rsquo; tea, lemme bring you up a hard b&rsquo;iled
aig!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s answer was to throw a pillow at
Kettle, who dodged it and went clattering
downstairs.</p>

<p>What a strange, unnatural day it was for
Betty! Here in the brilliant afternoon, when
she was wont to be her brightest and best, she
lay huddled up in her bed, racked with physical
and mental pain. Her sunny room was
dark, and her active little feet felt like lead.
The prospect of a party, the music, the dancing,
the bright interchange of looks and words
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>that was the wine of life to Betty&rsquo;s pleasure-loving
temperament, seemed to her now a
dreadful ordeal, to be gone through with
courage, and by a stupendous effort to let no
one suspect the agony of her mind. Never
before had she felt humiliated in the presence
of any man, but she felt a sharp humiliation
at the thought that in the first encounter of
her will with Fortescue&rsquo;s, she had been defeated;
whether by her own unreason or his,
was equally painful. But there was no back-down
in Betty, and she never dreamed of
staying away from the party or giving up the
fight because of an aching heart.</p>

<p>The old Colonel downstairs in the sitting-room
felt his heart wrung for his little Betty.
Too soon had come to her those shocks and
disappointments against which youth rebels.
The young demand happiness of life, and are
in despair when they first find they cannot
secure it.</p>

<p>Kettle, after having taken up Betty&rsquo;s tea,
came downstairs again, and, instead of going
into the kitchen, where he belonged, came into
the sitting-room and, perching his small,
black, and miserable self upon a little cricket,
fixed his eyes upon the Colonel&rsquo;s grave, gray
face, outlined against the window-pane. The
boy sat so still and silent that the Colonel at
last roused himself and asked kindly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Kettle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;tall matter wid me, suh,
but sumpin&rsquo; is the matter wid Miss Betty, an&rsquo;
it kinder makes me feel bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel sighed; it made him feel bad,
too.</p>

<p>All the afternoon, Kettle sat there until it
was time to milk old Bossy, a duty which he
had monopolized for some time past. Then
there was wood and water to be brought, and
all the other duties which Aunt Tulip had devised
for him. But when they were over
Kettle crept softly upstairs and seated himself
on the top step close to Betty&rsquo;s door. At
seven o&rsquo;clock, Betty opened the door that she
might call down to Aunt Tulip to assist her in
getting into her gown. She almost fell over
Kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here, Kettle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; ter see ef you don&rsquo; want
nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was Kettle&rsquo;s excuse.</p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s inarticulate sympathy touched
Betty&rsquo;s heart in the midst of her own unhappiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do want something,&rdquo; she said kindly.
&ldquo;I want you to tell Aunt Tulip to come here,
and to bring up some more wood, and to do
all sorts of things that nobody can do for me
except you, Kettle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle&rsquo;s black face beamed. He ran downstairs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>after Aunt Tulip, and then began bringing
wood, toiling up the stairs with as much
as he could carry.</p>

<p>Although Betty was dressed as gaily as
usual for a party, and took as much pains
with her beautiful brown hair and the wreath
of ivy-leaves upon it, Kettle&rsquo;s sharp eyes were
not deceived. Something was wrong with
Miss Betty.</p>

<p>When old Whitey pulled the rockaway up
to the door, Betty came down to show herself
as usual to the Colonel. The unspoken pity
in his eyes moved Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Grandfather,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any more cowardice in me than
there is in you. I intend to be just as happy
to-night as ever I was, and to dance and laugh
and sing as I always do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then poor Betty laughed a laugh so
forced, so full of pain, so unlike her usual
rippling laughter, that the Colonel&rsquo;s heart
was wrung more than ever. But he knew
better than to offer Betty pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stiffen up, my dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Life is
full of disappointments. Fortescue is not the
man you took him for, that is all. Put him
out of your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied Betty stoutly, without
the slightest ability to keep her word in the
matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Driving along the hard country road in the
wintry night, Betty thought of all those things
she might do by which a headstrong, proud,
and deeply sensitive girl may inflict pain upon
herself as well as another. She would, of
course, give Fortescue back his ring that
night, and the next day there were to be returned
a few trifles other than books and
flowers that he had sent her. The ring was a
simple thing, a little ruby heart surrounded
with small pearls. She had never worn it in
public, for fear it might attract attention&mdash;people
in the country are observant of trifles.
But she loved the little ring as a symbol.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 468px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="468" height="200" alt="Storm" title="" />
</div>

<p>That night the party was at Red Plains,
and Betty knew she would meet the whole
county. There was no hall for dancing at
Red Plains, but the drawing-room was cleared
of furniture, and there the dancing went on.
As Betty entered the drawing-room, almost
the first person she saw was Fortescue dancing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>vigorously with Sally Carteret. Betty
was besieged with partners, and immediately
whirled off with one of them. When the music
stopped, she found herself close to Fortescue,
near the great fireplace in which the Christmas
fire burned. They both spoke cordially
and smiling, but as Betty withdrew her hand
from Fortescue&rsquo;s grasp, she left in it the little
ring. Fortescue was exasperated, as any man
would be, by the promptness of this stab, and,
while talking gaily with Betty, dropped the
ring into the open fire, unseen by any except
her. Betty&rsquo;s heart gave a great throb of pain.
She loved her little ring, and it seemed to her
an insult that Fortescue should destroy it
before her eyes.</p>

<p>They danced together, and talked so merrily
that no one suspected the gulf which they
themselves had dug between them, so great is
the folly, the rashness, the headlong pride, of
youth. Each had a fierce pride which prevented
them from showing their self-inflicted
wounds to the world, or making an outcry at
that dreadful, gratuitous and unnecessary
pain which the young inflict upon themselves.
As Betty danced, she thought about the poor
princess who had to walk upon burning
plough-shares. If she were a real princess,
Betty thought, she smiled bravely during her
agony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>The merriment, the dancing, the pretty
Christmas observances, that Betty had loved
so much, all seemed now to her wearisome and
joyless. She longed for the time to come
when the ball would be over, and she could be
alone, and thought with distaste of the half a
dozen parties ahead of her. This was very
much increased by the news spread abroad
that a ball was to be given at Rosehill on
Christmas Eve. Fortescue invited everybody
cordially and pleasantly to his ball, saying he
could not hope to do things as picturesquely
as they did them, but he would do his best.
Everybody had accepted his invitation with
alacrity. He had made himself popular in a
community where newcomers were usually
looked upon askant, and the prospect of Rosehill
being once more opened at Christmas time
pleased the young people immensely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="350" height="179" alt="Church" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Miss Betty, you will come,&rdquo;
said Fortescue cordially, his heart hardening
against Betty as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I will,&rdquo; she answered, with a
brilliant smile. &ldquo;I shall be glad to see Rosehill
gay once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the ball was over, in the early hours
of the morning, with the earth still wrapped in
pitch darkness, and Betty was driving home,
a faint moan escaped her lips. It was bad
enough to have to meet Fortescue constantly,
but to go to Rosehill&mdash;&mdash; She might, it is
true, deceive everybody in the county on a pretense
of illness, but she could not deceive Fortescue,
the person whom she most wished to
deceive. She would go, no matter what it
cost her.</p>

<p>The ball at Rosehill was a torturing thing
to Betty. By that time, as it is with the wild
hearts of youth, she had a settled and burning
resentment against Fortescue, which she concealed
from the world with pretty smiles and
gay words. Fortescue, as he said, could not
do things as the county people did, but with
well meant generosity he did everything well
at his ball so far as money could go. There
was a profusion of flowers ordered from Baltimore,
along with the conventional supper,
totally unlike what the county people had, and
a band of music beside which the fiddles of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>Isaac Minkins and Uncle Cesar and the &ldquo;lap
organ&rdquo; paled. These novelties pleased everybody
except Betty, who walked through the
rooms where she had spent nineteen years of
her short life, and looked around her with a
supercilious smile that infuriated Fortescue.</p>

<p>The ball kept up late. Fortescue was an
admirable host, and his guests enjoyed themselves.
It was quite five o&rsquo;clock before the
last guest had left, and during the night there
had been a fall of snow. The lights were out,
and Fortescue, in his bedroom, which had
once been Betty&rsquo;s, was smoking his last cigar,
and cursing the treachery of a woman&mdash;of
Betty Beverley, who had won his brave and
honest heart, and then, through sheer unreason
and heartlessness, had cast him off.
He threw the stump of his cigar savagely into
the fire, and, going to the window which looked
toward Holly Lodge, put it up to inhale the
cold, clear air. The blackness and darkness
had given way to a pale gray, which preceded
the dawn, and by the ghostly half-light, he
saw from the roof of Holly Lodge a great
cloud of black smoke ascend, and little
tongues of flame leaping wickedly.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">THE HAND OF DESTINY</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Fortescue saw the thin cloud of
smoke curling upward from the roof of Holly
Lodge, he sprang up, and, still in his evening
clothes and dancing pumps, ran downstairs,
ringing bells and shouting aloud as he ran.
The servants flocked out half-dressed, and
Fortescue, calling to them to follow him and
bring buckets with them, sped across the open
field to Holly Lodge. Quiet and still was the
house in the dawn of the wintry morning, and
apparently asleep. The burning roof had not
yet awakened the household, as the smoke and
flames were borne upward. Fortescue hammered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>at the little front door, and, as the
flames began to crackle, put his shoulder to
the door and burst it in by main force. The
Colonel, in his dressing-gown and slippers,
was just coming out of his bedroom on the
first floor, and at that minute Kettle, struggling
into his trousers, rushed into the hall,
followed by Aunt Tulip and Uncle Cesar in
very sketchy toilettes, Kettle shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is afire, an&rsquo; Miss Betty, she
upsty&rsquo;ars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue ran up the narrow stair, two
steps at a time. As he reached the landing,
Betty opened her door. She was dressed as
when she left the ball; even the wreath of
ivy leaves on her rich hair was undisturbed.
It was not necessary to tell her what was the
matter. The shouts and cries below and the
roaring and crackling of the flames were
enough. Fortescue seized her cloak off a
chair and threw it around her, then they both
fled downstairs. The roof over the little
kitchen wing was burning furiously as the
heat melted the snow, but a white mantle lay
heavily upon the other part of the roof, and
it seemed possible to save the house. By that
time the servants from Rosehill had come
running, and Fortescue, throwing off his coat,
climbed upon the roof and organized a bucket
brigade. It was hard work to save the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>house, but, by the blessing of the snow and
every possible device, it seemed as if the fire
could be confined to the roof. It no longer
raged and roared, but smouldered. On the
lawn, Betty and the Colonel and Aunt Tulip,
shivering in spite of being well wrapped up,
watched the fight made against the fire, and
led by Fortescue. Suddenly a cry went up:
where was Kettle? Betty ran around the
house, calling at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kettle, Kettle, where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no response. Then Betty, despite
the Colonel&rsquo;s efforts to hold her, rushed
in the open door of the house, still calling
frantically for Kettle. Fortescue saw her,
and, swinging himself down from the roof,
ran into the house after her. Outside, Colonel
Beverley, his hands over his eyes, groaned
aloud. Fortescue seized Betty in the little
water drenched sitting-room, and, without a
word, took her in his arms and carried her
out. Betty resisted with all her girl&rsquo;s
strength. She was without fear, and naturally
venturesome, and she felt that Kettle was
being left to his fate, but there was a strange
delight, a sudden joy, in being held close to
Fortescue&rsquo;s strongly beating heart. Then
Fortescue went back to find Kettle. Although
the fury of the fire was being subdued, great
clouds of smoke were pouring through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>house, and from the outside could be heard
his voice shouting as he went from room to
room, &ldquo;Kettle! Kettle! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="389" height="200" alt="Landscape" title="" />
</div>

<p>A vagrant gust of wind fanned the fire once
more into flame, and it looked as if the house
must go. The shingle roof over Betty&rsquo;s room
caught fire, and with a great roar and crackling
the blaze leaped upward toward the lowering
sky. Continually, Fortescue&rsquo;s voice
was heard calling for Kettle, as he searched
the upper floor, blazing and dense with smoke.
Suddenly his voice ceased, and no sound was
heard except the roar of the flames and the
cries and orders of those who were trying to
save the little house. Betty&rsquo;s heart stood
still: suppose Fortescue should never come
out of the house alive? She turned her head,
with its graceful wreath of ivy leaves, away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>from the blazing house, and could have
shrieked aloud in her agony of fear. Then,
through the open door of the house, and in
the midst of the dense smoke, she saw Fortescue
staggering, and carrying a black object in
his arms. It was Kettle, frightfully burned,
but conscious. In his hands he clutched a
little fan which was a part of Betty&rsquo;s outfit
for parties. One look at Fortescue showed
that he was not badly injured, although half
stifled by the smoke. No moan escaped from
Kettle, but as Betty ran up he opened his eyes
and, looking at her with a pitiful attempt at
his usual merry grin, gasped out feebly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, I done save yo&rsquo; party fan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty burst into a flood of tears. At that
moment a merciful downpour of rain came
from the leaden sky. The roaring of the
flames turned to a loud hissing and crackling
as clouds of steam mounted upward. It was
possible then to take Kettle into the house.
The Colonel&rsquo;s room had not been touched
either by water or fire, and it was there that
they carried Kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody go for Dr. Markham!&rdquo; cried
Betty.</p>

<p>A dozen willing feet ran to the stable, and
a dozen willing hands hitched up old Whitey
to the rockaway, and Uncle Cesar, climbing
into the little carriage, drove off furiously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>to the village two miles away. Meanwhile,
Aunt Tulip and Betty applied such simple
remedies as they knew to poor Kettle&rsquo;s
wounds. The Colonel stood by the boy, saying
to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be a man, Kettle, be a little man. The
doctor will soon be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty, doing all she could to alleviate the
little negro&rsquo;s sufferings, was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo; you cry, Miss Betty,&rdquo; gasped
Kettle. &ldquo;Why doan&rsquo; you do like me! I ain&rsquo;
cryin&rsquo; none. I tried fust for to save ole
Marse&rsquo;s fiddle, an&rsquo; then yo&rsquo; party things, but
I couldn&rsquo;t git nothin&rsquo; but the fan, the fire bu&rsquo;n
me so hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle closed his eyes and knew no more
for a time.</p>

<p>The fire was out, and the men from Rosehill
climbed down from the roof. Under Fortescue&rsquo;s
direction, they made a great fire in
the Colonel&rsquo;s fireplace.</p>

<p>Then began the terrible waiting for the
doctor to come. When Kettle could know no
more whether Betty was sitting by him or not,
she turned and saw Fortescue close beside her.
The shock, the horror, the nearness of awful
disaster, had torn away all reserve between
them. As they looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes,
they forgot the presence of Aunt Tulip, still
working over Kettle, and the Colonel sitting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>in a chair by the side of the pallet, his gray
head bent, and the rare salt tears of age trickling
upon his cheeks. Yet Betty and Fortescue
spoke calmly and conventionally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I ever thank you enough?&rdquo; said
Betty, putting her hand into Fortescue&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;Suppose the boy had died without any one
trying to rescue him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t let the poor little chap die like
a rat in a hole,&rdquo; answered Fortescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, after all, it was in vain,&rdquo; replied
Betty; &ldquo;but at least you tried to save him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue rose and went out. There was
still work to be done. The drenched house
had to be dried, fires made everywhere, planks
found and nailed over the gaping roof.</p>

<p>And so the time passed until the crunching
of the wheels upon the ground announced Dr.
Markham&rsquo;s arrival. The merciful downpour
of rain continued, and, although it was six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the murky day was
still dark. Dr. Markham walked into the
room and made a swift examination of Kettle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; replied Dr. Markham. &ldquo;It
is a bad case, but he may pull through.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">&ldquo;DOAN&rsquo; YOU CRY, MISS BETTY!&rdquo;</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> arrangements had to be made immediately
for the family at Holly Lodge. It
was found that, although the roof of the
kitchen was burned off and the roof over
Betty&rsquo;s room was badly damaged, three rooms
on the lower floor were uninjured, except by
water. In the midst of the drenching rain,
planks were nailed over the burned part of
the roof, and the kitchen and Betty&rsquo;s room
were made temporarily habitable. Fortescue
promptly invited the whole household over to
Rosehill, and to bring Kettle with them where
he could be nursed, but this was gratefully
declined by the Colonel. It was certain that
as soon as their plight was known all the
neighbors and friends of the Holly Lodge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>family would offer refuge to them. But at
present it was impossible to move Kettle.</p>

<p>When everything possible had been done,
Fortescue said good-by, leaving a couple of
his servants at Holly Lodge to do what was
necessary. Colonel Beverley thanked Fortescue
heartily, but that only hastened his departure.
When he was gone, Betty went up
to her room, from which the open sky was
excluded by the planks nailed over the roof,
and from which the floods of water had been
wiped up and a great fire started. As she
looked in her mirror, by the pale light of a
cloudy morning, she realized that it was
Christmas day. The thought gave her a
shock; she had forgotten it until then. She
took off her simple evening gown, which was
torn and muddy and stained, removed the
wreath from her head, and put on the plain
black wool gown she wore every day. Then,
going downstairs, she reduced things to order
as much as possible. Some holly wreaths had
been hung in the windows, and the Colonel&rsquo;s
portrait decorated with the usual laurel
leaves, and the little gifts for Christmas were
in a cupboard in the sitting-room. The Colonel
was sitting before the great fire, looking
so pale and spent that Betty&rsquo;s heart was
moved for him. She went up to him, and,
kissing him softly, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Granddaddy, have you forgotten that
this is Christmas morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I had, my dear,&rdquo; answered the
Colonel. &ldquo;It has been such a terrible Christmas
morning, and that poor little black boy
suffers so that it put everything else out of
my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>Without a word, Betty showed the Colonel
the gifts that were meant for Kettle. Aunt
Tulip, who was a great knitter, had knitted
him four pairs of good woolen socks. Uncle
Cesar had bought him, at the village store, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>top and a bag of marbles, treasures which
Kettle had never owned in all his short life.
The Colonel had given him a new suit of
clothes, and Betty had bought him a pocket-knife.
Betty&rsquo;s tears dropped upon these
things as she showed them to the Colonel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a willing little fellow,&rdquo; said the
Colonel, with a break in his voice.</p>

<p>In the cupboard also lay Kettle&rsquo;s gifts.
Kettle was not equal to writing, although he
could read a little, but with infinite labor he
had printed on slips of paper the names of
those for whom his little presents were meant.
Aunt Tulip had a butter paddle, fashioned by
Kettle himself. He had a little fund of his
own, which he had earned in the summer by
selling soft crabs in the little village, and this
he had expended according to his best judgment,
but the selections made Betty smile
through her tears. Knowing the Colonel was
fond of reading, Kettle had bought from a
travelling salesman a book entitled &ldquo;The
Principles of Hydraulics in Mining.&rdquo; For
Uncle Cesar was a yellow cravat with blue
spots, and for Betty was his principal gift&mdash;a
large brass brooch, with a huge imitation
emerald in it. Betty put all these things back
carefully, weeping the while. &ldquo;Let us hope,
my dear,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;that the little
fellow will live to see many Christmas days.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>In the afternoon Betty relieved Aunt Tulip
at Kettle&rsquo;s bedside. Dr. Markham came
again, and was secretly surprised to find the
boy still living, though unconscious. In spite
of the deadening drug that made him unconscious
of his pain, Kettle would move about
occasionally, muttering:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder ef ole Marse&rsquo; fiddle got bu&rsquo;nd
up? I reckon my Chris&rsquo;mus stockin&rsquo; got
bu&rsquo;nd up, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bed was made up for the Colonel in the
sitting-room, and Betty was enabled to get a
night&rsquo;s sleep by Sally Carteret&rsquo;s insisting on
sitting up with Kettle. By that time the
neighbors and friends had heard of the calamity
at Holly Lodge, and all the day and
evening relays of persons had come, bringing
everything that could possibly be of use,
making every offer of service and each insisting
on carrying the whole Holly Lodge family
off somewhere else. But this last kindness
was gratefully declined, and, accepting such
help as they needed, the Colonel and Betty
determined to remain at Holly Lodge.</p>

<p>The next morning, Kettle was conscious
and in terrible pain, but an occasional sharp
cry was the only complaint wrung from him.
Whenever Betty would say, her eyes brimming
with pitiful tears, &ldquo;Kettle, I know the
pain is dreadful,&rdquo; Kettle would reply stoutly:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t, Miss Betty. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t as bad
as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For days and nights this went on, but Kettle
hung on gallantly to his life, and in the midst
of his agony would gasp out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doan&rsquo; you cry, Miss Betty. This heah
pain is a-gittin&rsquo; better all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of a week Dr. Markham said that
Kettle would get well. His burns were very
bad, but his face and hands were not disfigured,
and although his body would be
scarred for life, he might yet be restored to
health. The kitchen and Aunt Tulip&rsquo;s room
had been repaired, and Kettle was transferred
to Aunt Tulip&rsquo;s room, while Uncle
Cesar occupied the little cubby-hole where
Kettle had slept.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">CALM WEATHER</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gradually</span> the little house at Holly Lodge
assumed its usual aspect. The Colonel and
Betty were flooded with offers of hospitality
and with all sorts of services&mdash;those kindly
acts which in country communities bridge
over catastrophes. Fortescue was gone,
having left the second day after Christmas.
On that day he had come over to Holly Lodge
to say good-by and to offer the resources of
Rosehill in any emergency. He had come
while Betty was watching Kettle, and although
the Colonel urged that he might call
her, Fortescue evaded it, and cut his visit
short. The Colonel asked him if he himself
had suffered any evil effects from the fire.
Fortescue replied that his eyes had given him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>some trouble from the smoke, and that he
would use the rest of his leave in going to
New York to see an oculist. He supposed it
was nothing, and that his eyes would cease
to trouble him probably before he got to
New York. The Colonel told this to Betty
in good faith, but Betty&rsquo;s interpretation was
that Fortescue needed an excuse to go away
as soon as possible, and gave herself no concern
about his eyes. In her heart, however,
still burned a deep resentment, and a longing
regret for Fortescue. He was so brave&mdash;he
was so much the soldier&mdash;and then Betty
would check herself sternly, and try to think
of him no more.</p>

<p>As the winter days went by, Kettle grew
stronger, and was able to sit up in a little
chair by the kitchen fire. Betty spent many
hours amusing him, his little round, black
face delighted with the simple games she
taught him and the stories she told him. His
Christmas presents had been given him, and
of them all his new pocket-knife was his chief
delight. He would sit by the hour before the
kitchen fire, whittling industriously, and Aunt
Tulip never once complained of the clutter he
made. Betty charmed him by occasionally
wearing the great green and gilt brooch, and
the Colonel religiously read through &ldquo;The
Principles of Hydraulics in Mining.&rdquo; In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>evening, before Aunt Tulip put him to bed,
it was Kettle&rsquo;s treat to be helped into the
sitting-room and to listen to Betty playing
and singing to her harp, or the Colonel playing
on his violin. The boy&rsquo;s arms had been
frightfully burned, but his hands had escaped.
Several times he said to Betty, with a strange
look of distress upon his little black face:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, I want to arsk you sumpin&rsquo;.
I want you to arsk the doctor sumpin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Kettle?&rdquo; Betty would inquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you pres&rsquo;ny,&rdquo; Kettle would reply.
But the &ldquo;pres&rsquo;ny&rdquo; did not come for a long
time. Then, one day in March, when Kettle
was able to walk about and was almost well,
he crept up to Betty in the garden, and said
to her hesitatingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, what I want you to arsk the
doctor is, whether I kin ever play the fiddle
agin. I been tryin&rsquo; to arsk &rsquo;im, but somehow
I k&rsquo;yarn&rsquo; do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, I will ask the doctor, Kettle,&rdquo;
answered Betty cheerfully, &ldquo;and I am sure
you will be able to play the fiddle. Yonder is
Doctor Markham&rsquo;s buggy coming down the
lane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty met the doctor at the house door.
Kettle had slipped away; he evidently had
not the courage to stay. Then Betty put her
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly he will be able to play the
fiddle,&rdquo; replied Dr. Markham, smiling over
his spectacles. &ldquo;That little fellow is as hard
as nails. There isn&rsquo;t one child in a hundred
who would have survived such injuries. But
he&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty called Kettle, who reappeared
around the corner of the house. He came
slouching up, with a faint shadow of his former
grin upon his face. Something in Betty&rsquo;s
eyes told him that there was good news for
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, you young rascal!&rdquo; cried the doctor
jovially. &ldquo;In another month or two you will
be running around here as mischievous as
ever, and you will be able to fiddle all right
when you get stronger. But you are not to
touch the fiddle until I tell you. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sirree,&rdquo; answered Kettle delightedly,
his mouth coming wide open. Then,
looking from Betty to the doctor, and back
again, and shuffling his feet awkwardly, he
tried to express some of the gratitude that
filled his humble little heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, she treat me white, and so
did you, Doc&rsquo; Markham. I ain&rsquo; a-gwine ter
furgit it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Markham went in the house to see the
Colonel, who was ailing, and who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>ailing a good deal that winter. The doctor&rsquo;s
cheery smile and pleasant words brightened
the Colonel up immensely. When Dr. Markham
rose to go, after one of those long and
friendly visits of the country doctor which are
so comforting, Betty went out with him.
Kettle was waiting outside in the spring sunshine.
In his hand was a small object, carefully
wrapped up in white paper. Kettle
shuffled up to the doctor as he was getting
into his buggy, and said to him, with much
stammering and stuttering:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="433" height="200" alt="Lone Tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I done heah that folks pays doctors fur
comin&rsquo; to see &rsquo;em. I ain&rsquo; got no money, but I
got a mighty nice knife as Miss Betty gimme
last Chris&rsquo;mus, and I want you, Doc&rsquo; Markham,
fur to take it. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t much fur you,
but it&rsquo;s all I got, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;se mighty glad to give
it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Markham took the knife, looked at it,
and admired it, and put it in his pocket, and
then, taking off his hat, shook Kettle&rsquo;s little
black hand warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, Kettle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from the
bottom of my heart. I never had a fee in my
life that meant more than this knife. I shall
keep and use it, and whenever I look at it I
shall remember an honest little boy, who will
grow up to be an honest man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle&rsquo;s face was shining, as the doctor
drove off, and which shone still more when
Betty said to him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you gave the doctor your knife,
Kettle. You shall have a new one next
Christmas, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">TWILIGHT</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spring came on apace, but instead of
bringing with it the joy of the springtime, an
atmosphere of settled sadness seemed to
descend upon the little house at Holly Lodge,
where a year ago there had been so much of
cheerfulness and merriment. The fire had
been a severe shock to Colonel Beverley, and
all at once the blight of age appeared to be
laid upon him. It was the same with Uncle
Cesar, and master and man, who had spent
nearly seventy years together, both seemed
passing into the shadowy path. Oftener than
ever the Colonel would send for Uncle Cesar,
and the two old men would talk of their youth
and of the four years of starvation and
marching and fighting during the war, and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>times and events long passed, of which they
were the sole survivors. When they fiddled
together in the evenings, the music was faint;
their bow arms were feeble, and their fingering
weak. Kettle, now almost recovered, was
able to do much of Uncle Cesar&rsquo;s work, and
would have done it all if he had been allowed.
Even old Whitey suddenly seemed to falter
under the burden of years, and had to be
coddled as old creatures should be. As for
Betty, it was as if in the midst of a spring
morning the soft and purple twilight had
descended, as if all sounds of life were stilled
and the silence of the night were at hand. She
could hardly believe herself the same Betty
that had laughed and danced and sung so
merrily during her short life. There were
the same friends, the same generous hospitality,
the same kindly attentions from her
friends and neighbors as ever, but Betty now
kept close to Holly Lodge. She had a very
good excuse. The Colonel was growing more
and more infirm, and upon Betty&rsquo;s delicate
shoulders rested all the responsibilities of
three old persons and a child. She was quite
equal to it, but she could no longer go to
dances and picnics like Sally Carteret and the
other girls of her acquaintance. It was true
that a way for her to go about was always
provided by the kindness of those who remembered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>that Whitey was an old horse, and that
Uncle Cesar was an old man. But Betty was
rather glad of the excuse to stay at home.
She had plenty to keep her occupied all day,
but in the soft spring dusk and the moonlit
midsummer nights, and the cool autumn twilights
she would go into the garden and walk
up and down the path bordered by the box
hedge. In all that time Fortescue was never
absent from her mind. She could see with
the eyes of the mind his lithe, military figure,
his clear-cut, aquiline face, his close-cropped
dark head, and could hear his rich, pleasant
voice. A painful and humiliating conviction
was forcing itself upon Betty&rsquo;s mind; she
began to fear that she had played the fool.
At heart, she was the soul of good, practical
sense, and an act of folly mortified and
offended her as it does those who are sound
and sane. After a while, she faced the hateful
truth that she had acted arrogantly and
foolishly, and apparently without heart.
Fortescue had been clearly within his rights,
and what he had said about providing for the
Colonel and everything being made easy by
the power of money, instead of being dictatorial
and purse-proud, as Betty had thought,
was really generous and provident. To lose
perfect happiness by accident or the fault of
another is hard enough, but to lose it by one&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>own folly and rashness was heartbreaking to
Betty&rsquo;s frank soul and candid temperament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, after all,&rdquo; thought Betty, when in
these twilight walks she glanced toward the
pile of Rosehill, mute and dark and uninhabited,
&ldquo;it could not have been. How is it possible
that I, Betty Beverley, should ever be
the mistress of Rosehill, and have Grandfather
with me and be the wife of Fortescue?
No, it was too much. The gods are none too
generous. I had a treasure in the hollow of
my hand, and I threw it away. I shall not
have it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A subtle change came over Betty&rsquo;s look and
manner. She was as brave as ever, but instead
of the daring light in her eyes and the
joyous laughter on her lips, were the calm
courage of endurance and a softness and gentleness
greater than she had ever before
known. She spent every hour that was possible
with the Colonel, sitting by him with her
sewing&mdash;for Betty did all her own sewing&mdash;or
reading to him, or playing and singing to
him; and to all in the little house, from the
Colonel down to little black Kettle, Betty
was their light and strength, their guardian
angel. Life had turned its stern face upon
her, and Betty was learning bravely and
quietly the meaning of that sternness.</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">RECOMPENCE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer slipped into the autumn, and
the gold and brown and crimson October
days, with twilight skies of amethyst and
pearl, were at hand. Betty&rsquo;s hours were very
full. The Colonel was growing daily more
feeble, but his indomitable eyes reflected an
unquenchable spirit. Only, he was gentler,
tenderer, graver. As the year grew old, and
the swallows flew southward, and the cry of
the wild geese clanged in the blue air, a note
of sadness seemed brooding upon the world.
Betty was a softer, quieter Betty than she had
ever been, and there was a poignant sweetness
in her smile and in her eyes, which sometimes
held unshed tears. But it was ever a brave
Betty. Her smiles were for the Colonel, and
the faithful servants, and poor little Kettle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>Her tears were for the few solitary hours she
could command. These hours were when she
lay in her little white bed at night, wakeful,
and a scant half-hour at twilight, when she
could walk up and down the garden path, by
the box hedge. And her thoughts were all
of Fortescue, and her heart, poor prisoner
that it was, beat against the bars of fate and
uttered its mournful and passionate cry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="250" height="321" alt="Hedge" title="" />
</div>

<p>And so the autumn passed slowly.</p>

<p>One afternoon in late October, Betty, hap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>pening
to glance through her window toward
Rosehill, saw the shutters thrown wide, and
the blue smoke curling out of the chimneys.
She started and trembled; it was as if a finger
had been laid upon an exposed nerve, and she
said to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not let anything that happens at
Rosehill affect me. I will not let myself
dream or wish,&rdquo; a thing easier said than done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>She slipped downstairs and into the garden,
and began the steady walk up and down
by the box hedge; this walk was sometimes
the only fresh air she could get during the
day. The afternoon was mild, and some
hardy chrysanthemums, their bold faces
flaunting in the autumn air, sent forth a pungent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>perfume. Whenever Betty walked in
that spot, she could live over again the few
happy hours of her love. This afternoon, the
sight of Rosehill occupied, and the possibility
that Fortescue might be there, agitated her.
As she walked along in the red light of the
declining day, she glanced up and saw Fortescue
coming along the garden path toward
her. There was something different in his
aspect and carriage from what there had
been, so Betty&rsquo;s quick and far-seeing glance
showed her at once. She stood still, while her
heart beat wildly and the ever-ready blood
poured into her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>When Fortescue reached her, he held out
his hand without a word, and Betty put hers
into it. For a moment they stood in agitated
silence. The woman, naturally, recovered
herself first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not heard that you were at Rosehill,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I only noticed just now
smoke coming out of the chimneys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I arrived this morning,&rdquo; answered
Fortescue quietly, &ldquo;to stay some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;you have a long
leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an indefinite leave,&rdquo; replied Fortescue.</p>

<p>Betty glanced at him in silence and surprise.
They were then pacing slowly up and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>down the walk in the light of the scarlet and
gold sunset. She saw that Fortescue was thin
and pale, and that there were strange marks
under his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been ill?&rdquo; she asked, the words
coming involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; replied Fortescue, and
stopped.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes again sought Fortescue&rsquo;s.
There was evidently something the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have your eyes been troubling you?&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fortescue.</p>

<p>He seemed disinclined to give any particulars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Betty, after a pause,
and a thread of light stealing into her mind,
&ldquo;that after the fire, when you came over the
next day, my grandfather told me that the
smoke had affected your eyes. Did it turn
out to be anything serious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is that why you have an indefinite
leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty was determined to wring the truth
out of Fortescue, and at last succeeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;the smoke affected my
eyes very strangely. I went to New York,
and saw the best oculists there, and they told
me my eyes would probably recover, and did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>a variety of things for me, but nothing seemed
to do me any good. Then I got leave and went
to Paris and Vienna, with no better result.
All the doctors have agreed that to live a
quiet country life, free from excitement, was
my best chance. Of course I had to get sick
leave, but I would not ask to be retired. I
shall fight my retirement as long as I can. I
want to be back in active service.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Holly Lodge" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Betty promptly,
her eyes plenteous with pity. &ldquo;It is a terrible
thing to be retired at your age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause, and they continued
mechanically to pace slowly up and down the
garden path in the dying glow of the October
afternoon. Presently Fortescue spoke:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I should have come
here or not. But it was so lonely at Rosehill&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t read, you know&mdash;and you said we
were to be friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty, who could usually control her tears
marvellously, suddenly felt them dropping
upon her cheeks. They came quickly in a
flood and with gasping little sobs. It was
through her that Fortescue was menaced with
this calamity, that this tragic closing of his
soldier&rsquo;s life had come, perhaps never to be
reopened. Her heart was so wrung with this
thought, she did not know that she was weeping,
but Fortescue knew it. He felt she had
injured him and even insulted him by her
conduct, and he had once thought she had no
heart, but now a strange and quick conviction
came to him that Betty was very far from
being a heartless coquette. And with it came
a sudden illumination concerning himself.
He had been very hasty, very dictatorial.
After all, their quarrel had not been about a
trifle, but about what was to become of Colonel
Beverley, a serious matter for them to
consider, and Betty had shown more unselfishness
than he. Fortescue put some of this
in broken words. He took out his handkerchief,
and, with his arm around Betty, wiped
away the tears that were streaming down her
cheeks, and Betty, the haughty, the arrogant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>the resolute Betty, laid her head on Fortescue&rsquo;s
shoulder, and they asked forgiveness of
each other, like two children that have quarrelled.
But they were not children: their
hearts were strong, and each knew its mate.</p>

<p>A half-hour went by; neither Betty nor
Fortescue could have told what passed, except
that there were clinging kisses, and whispered
pleas for forgiveness, and tender promises.
They were so quiet and low-voiced that the
blue pigeons which nested in the pigeon-house
close by the hedge fluttered around them,
looking at them, and making little cooing
sounds as they stopped close to them on the
brown earth. At last the tension of emotion
subsided a little, and Betty made Fortescue
tell her all the details of his trouble. His case
was peculiar. There was not much obvious
injury to his eyes, so the doctors said, only
he could not see very well. But that was
enough. He hoped that in a year or two,
perhaps, with country air and rest and quiet,
a cure might be worked. Betty, with all her
old confidence, and smiling bravely, declared
he could get well, he should get well, he must
get well.</p>

<p>They stayed out until the sunset glow was
past and the purple dusk had come. Then it
was Betty who sent Fortescue home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask you to stay to supper,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>said, &ldquo;because I want first to tell Grandfather
that we have made up. Haven&rsquo;t we made
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fortescue&rsquo;s answer was a true lover&rsquo;s
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have made up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as you
know right from wrong better than I do, I
mean to do what you think best, Betty, if we
have to be engaged for thirty-four years, until
I shall be retired, even if I get my eyesight
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Betty, with a
wicked smile. &ldquo;Let us see how long you will
remain in that virtuous frame of mind.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="no-indent chap_name">GLORIA</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Fortescue was walking across the
brown stubble of the fields to Rosehill, Betty,
in the firelit sitting-room, was telling the
Colonel all about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you must not worry, Grandfather,
about my leaving you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because
Jack has said that he will leave all that to
me, and we can find a way, depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel thought that he knew a way, a
very easy and good way, by which most problems
are finally solved, but he did not speak of
this to Betty. He only said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, my dear, will make me
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Fortescue appeared, and
looked much more like his old cheerful self
than he had the day before. Betty blushed up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>to her eyes when Fortescue said smiling, to
the Colonel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Colonel, I may as well make a clean
breast of it. I have come this morning to ask
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, Betty suddenly dropped her needlework
and scurried frantically out of the room.</p>

<p>Fortescue and the Colonel talked a long
time together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I surmise what your disagreement and
my granddaughter&rsquo;s was about,&rdquo; said the
Colonel. &ldquo;I think you both did me an injustice
in supposing that I would stand in the
way of the child&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fortescue told about his trouble with
his eyes, and his chances of remaining in the
army, and all the details with which the Colonel
was so familiar and so sympathetic.</p>

<p>It was quite twelve o&rsquo;clock before Betty and
her lover had their next walk up and down the
garden path behind the tall box hedge.</p>

<p>Fortescue&rsquo;s arrival had very much puzzled
Kettle, and he asked Aunt Tulip what it
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; sniffed Aunt Tulip. &ldquo;It means
that Mr. Fortescue is jes&rsquo; dead stuck on Miss
Betty, an&rsquo; Miss Betty, she kinder got a shine
fur Mr. Fortescue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle determined to satisfy himself, and,
watching his chance, when Betty had returned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>to the Colonel in the sitting-room, marched
in and planting himself before Betty, asked
anxiously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Betty, is Mr. Fortescue dead stuck
on you, an&rsquo; is you got a kinder shine fur Mr.
Fortescue?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="250" height="325" alt="Rocking Chair" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, you impudent boy?&rdquo;
screamed Betty, red and furious, while the
Colonel laughed. &ldquo;How dare you ask such
things? I have a great mind to give you a
good slap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, Miss Betty, Aunt Tulip, she tole me
so,&rdquo; replied Kettle, deeply injured. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
I jes&rsquo; thought I&rsquo;d arsk you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Betty could not help laughing, and when
Fortescue came for his afternoon visit&mdash;for
two visits a day were the least he could get
along with, so he swore&mdash;Betty told him of
Kettle&rsquo;s iniquity. Instead of denouncing
Kettle, Fortescue laughed uproariously, and,
calling the boy out of the kitchen, where he
was peeling potatoes for Aunt Tulip, handed
him what Kettle described as &ldquo;a whole round
silver dollar,&rdquo; and said, still laughing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kettle, I am dead stuck on Miss Betty,
and she has got a kind of a shine for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, now, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said the aggrieved
Kettle. &ldquo;An&rsquo; you was a-gwine ter
slap me fur axin&rsquo; you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a week or two, Fortescue mustered
up courage to ask the Colonel, since he had
said that he would not stand in the way of
Betty&rsquo;s happiness, if Betty and himself could
be married, and, if so, would the Colonel come
to Rosehill to live for the present. The Colonel
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Holly Lodge and Cesar
and Aunt Tulip and this little black Kettle
will see me out my time. It is a part of a true
philosophy to take short views of life. You
are at Rosehill for another year, anyhow, and
I shall remain at Holly Lodge. You and
Betty will come over to see me occasionally,
I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>Armed with this information, Fortescue
went to Betty, and promptly repudiated his
promise to wait until Betty was ready before
he mentioned marriage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="350" height="179" alt="Church" title="" />
</div>

<p>On a bright December day, mild for the
season, Betty and Fortescue were married
in the old Colonial church. Betty, who loved
show, insisted that there should be a real
military wedding, and so from the great fortress
forty miles away came a dozen dashing
young officers. There was a great train of
bridesmaids, Sally Carteret leading them in
beauty as well as precedence. Never had the
old church seen such a blaze of gold lace and
glittering epaulets and gilt sword-hilts and
splendid chapeaux. Everybody in the county
came to Betty&rsquo;s wedding, and waited breathlessly
for the entrance of the bridal party.
Fortescue, with his best man, both in gorgeous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>new full-dress uniforms, were waiting
smiling in the chancel. Before the bridal
train entered, came Uncle Cesar and Aunt
Tulip, Uncle Cesar in a new suit of clothes
and carrying in his hand a superannuated
silk hat of the Colonel&rsquo;s. Aunt Tulip wore a
large red and green plaid gown and a black
hat with pink roses, and both wore large
wedding favors of white satin. Behind them,
with great solemnity, marched Kettle. He
was arrayed in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit,
made by Aunt Tulip with the aid of a paper
pattern, out of an old green riding habit of
Betty&rsquo;s. A large collar of cotton lace
adorned Kettle&rsquo;s shoulders, and he, too, wore
a wedding favor as large as a cabbage, with
ends that hung below his knees. In dignity
and importance, Kettle considered that he
ranked next the bride, and enjoyed hugely
being the cynosure of all eyes as he strutted
up the aisle. Then came the dozen stalwart
young officers in splendid uniforms, and, after
them, the rosebud garden of girls in fluttering
gauzes and chiffons. When they had all
reached the chancel, the officers drew their
swords and made an archway of the shining
blue blades over the heads of the Colonel,
and Betty in her bridal veil. Never was there
a more smiling bride in the old church. Fortescue
shouted his responses in what Betty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>called his &ldquo;parade ground voice,&rdquo; while
Betty&rsquo;s answers, though soft, were clear.</p>

<p>The wedding party went back to Holly
Lodge, which was too cramped to entertain
more than a small party. There was punch
in the old Lowestoft punch-bowl, and, according
to tradition, the bride&rsquo;s cake was cut with
the groom&rsquo;s sword. Fortescue&rsquo;s brothers,
fine young fellows, were present, and also his
father, who, Betty readily agreed, was, as
Fortescue described him, &ldquo;the finest old dad
in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the time came for the bride and
bridegroom to leave for the steamboat landing,
a handsome carriage and pair, one of the
gifts of Fortescue&rsquo;s father to Betty, drove up,
and as the bridal pair passed out, Uncle
Cesar and Kettle, standing on each side of
the doorway, played on their fiddles the old
air which the bands played in the London
streets for Queen Victoria&rsquo;s wedding procession,
&ldquo;Come, Haste to the Wedding.&rdquo; The
Colonel, in his feeble old baritone, sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, come at our bidding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this merry wedding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come see rural felicity.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was indeed felicity on the faces of
all, especially on that of the Colonel, as the
smiling bride gave him her last farewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>When all was over, and the guests had departed,
the Colonel went back into the little
sitting-room. There was Betty&rsquo;s harp and
Betty&rsquo;s little chair and Betty&rsquo;s geraniums
that she tended so diligently, but there was
no Betty. The Colonel seated himself in his
great chair, and for the first time turned it
around so that he could see Rosehill. Yes,
everything was just as it should be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In the twilight a little distressed voice
spoke at the Colonel&rsquo;s shoulder, and Kettle,
black and miserable, asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ole Marse, what we gwine do &rsquo;thout Miss
Betty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God only knows,&rdquo; replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>The Colonel had been without Betty only
for a couple of weeks when one morning,
some days before the bridal pair were expected,
Betty and Fortescue appeared on
their way from the river-landing. Betty flew
at the Colonel and kissed him all over his face,
and shook hands rapturously with Uncle
Cesar and Kettle, and hugged Aunt Tulip.
The sight of her joyous face was enough to
make the Colonel happy.</p>

<span class="no-indent" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</span><br />

<span class="no-indent chap_name">SUNSHINE</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> began the St. Martin&rsquo;s summer of an
old man&rsquo;s life. Every day the Colonel saw
Betty, and every day Fortescue performed
some act of kindness or attention to the old
people at Holly Lodge. There was no more
skimping and saving for Betty, and in lieu of
her one muslin gown for the Christmas festivities,
she had a dozen, and a rope of pearls
around her neck, and a riding habit from New
York, and Birdseye to ride every day. And
there was a great Christmas party at Rosehill,
the finest that had ever been known there,
so Betty privately resolved. Everything was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>to be done just as in the Christmas times of
old, reinforced by all the new and delightful
additions now in Betty&rsquo;s power. The Colonel
was to come over and spend the night
for the first time since he had left Rosehill, as
he thought, forever.</p>

<p>It was cold as on the first Christmas Eve
that Betty had met Fortescue, but the great
house at Rosehill was warm and alight.
Betty&rsquo;s first appearance as the chatelaine of
Rosehill was admirable, with everything thoroughly
well done. The music was furnished
by Isaac Minkins and Uncle Cesar and the
young gentleman of color with the &ldquo;lap organ,&rdquo;
reinforced by Kettle. To Kettle, his
professional dbut as a fiddler at &ldquo;Miss
Betty&rsquo;s Chris&rsquo;mus party&rdquo; was a solemn and
awe inspiring event, and he sawed away
without the glimpse of a grin upon his little
black face, but in his heart was exultation.
The supper was great and enough for five
times the number of guests. Apple toddy
flowed, and the eggnog was brewed in the
Beverley punch-bowl. There were Christmas
songs and Christmas dances, and it was
broad daylight on the Christmas morning before
the ball broke up. The Colonel insisted
on sitting it out, and even did a turn in the
Virginia reel with Mrs. Lindsay, in spite of
his rheumatism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>When everybody was gone, Fortescue gave
the Colonel an arm up the wide staircase to
his old room, and Betty was on the other side
of him, while Kettle brought up the rear with
the Colonel&rsquo;s stick, while Aunt Tulip and
Uncle Cesar awaited the procession in the
bedroom. Once in the room, the Colonel
looked around him in amazement. There
was his bed in the corner where it had stood
for so many decades, and his shaving table
at the same angle, his arm-chair was drawn
up to the blazing fire as if it had never left
the spot, and over the mantelpiece hung his
sword in its old place. The quaint old
daguerrotypes were open on the mantelpiece,
and everything was just as it had been until
three years before. The Colonel, a little pale,
dropped into the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Betty, leaning over him
in her shimmering evening gown and with
diamonds shining in her hair&mdash;&ldquo;it means that
you are not to go away any more. Jack sent
four men and a cart over to Holly Lodge the
minute you left, and all these things were
brought up the back stairs, and Aunt Tulip
arranged them. And Uncle Cesar is to undress
you and put you to bed, and you are to
throw the bootjack at him when you get
angry, just as you used to do. For Aunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>Tulip and Uncle Cesar are coming here to
live, too, and Kettle is to be your aide-de-camp,
and Holly Lodge is to be shut up. It
is a horrid little hole, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" width="300" height="202" alt="Holly Lodge" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now, as Betty had sworn and declared and
protested many times over upon her honor as
a lady and her faith as a Christian that Holly
Lodge was a most delightful little place, the
Colonel was much shocked at her moral turpitude,
but Betty excused herself by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it seemed well enough as long
as you and I were there together, but it must
be a horrid little hole without me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel submitted, as the old do, and
his submission was very much accelerated by
Fortescue saying promptly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Colonel, I am the commanding
officer at Rosehill, and you will not be permitted
to return to Holly Lodge, except under
guard or on your parole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the house was quiet, and Uncle Cesar
had put the Colonel to bed, as in the days
long past, the old soldier lay quiet and wakeful
in his high-post bed, watching through the
chinks of the shutters the dawning of the
bright Christmas day. His heart was at
peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is but for a little while,&rdquo; he said to
himself.</p>

<p>But the Colonel was to see one more Christmas,
a year later. On that day, Betty&rsquo;s boy,
the most beautiful baby ever seen, was to be
christened &ldquo;Beverley Fortescue&rdquo; for the old
Colonel. There was to be no Christmas ball
at Rosehill, for the Colonel was past going
downstairs, and sat in his great chair awaiting
from the Great Commander the order to
march. The baby was to be christened in the
Colonel&rsquo;s room, and out of the old bowl which
served both for eggnogs and for christenings.
Fortescue and the Colonel and Uncle Cesar
and Aunt Tulip and Kettle thought they never
saw so lovely a picture as Betty, with a pale,
glorified face, and wearing a long, clinging
white gown such as are seen in the pictures of
angels, holding her baby in her arms to receive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>baptism. The baby, beautiful and dark-eyed,
looked seriously at the new world about
him, and acted with the dignity worthy of his
name.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, and the old
clergyman, who had also baptized Betty when
she was a baby, was gone, Betty, holding her
boy in her lap, sat by the Colonel. Fortescue,
looking proudly at the baby, said, &ldquo;My son
shall be a soldier,&rdquo; and the baby nodded, as
much as to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kettle, in convulsions of delight, watched
him, while Aunt Tulip, in a nurse&rsquo;s cap and
a huge white apron, revelled in her new dignity
as the baby&rsquo;s mammy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said the Colonel to Uncle Cesar,
&ldquo;give me my sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Cesar took the sword down from over
the mantelpiece, and the Colonel putting the
hilt in the baby&rsquo;s hand, said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you this sword. It is all I have to
give, but it is much, for the sword means
honor, and you must keep your honor virgin,
and without rust or decay, like this sword.
And it means courage. You must fear no
one but God. And truth is a sword, and so
you must live and act and speak truthfully.
When years have passed and this sword
comes into your possession, your mother and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>father will tell you what I have said. May
you never forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The baby grasped the sword firmly with
his tiny hand, and his great dark eyes were
fixed gravely, as if he understood every word,
upon the brave old eyes of the Colonel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_title.jpg" width="350" height="204" alt="Rosehill" title="" />
</div>

<p>Then the sword was again hung upon the
wall, and they all went out of the room, leaving
the Colonel to rest, with Uncle Cesar to
watch him. For in those last hours, the
humble serving-man was close to his &ldquo;ole
Marse.&rdquo; Down in the hall, Fortescue was
saying to Betty, her hand in his:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a Christmas gift for you that I
haven&rsquo;t yet given you. I see the little dent in
the locket around your neck and the place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>where the chain is mended. I wouldn&rsquo;t tell
you until I had tested it, but I have had perfect
sight now for several days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Betty threw herself in his
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you can once more be
a soldier!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upstairs, the Colonel was talking feebly
with Uncle Cesar, his mind sounding the
deeps and shallows of memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;did you ever see
a more beautiful little fellow than my Betty&rsquo;s
son? He looks like Betty&rsquo;s father, the son I
gave my country. But it is all over now, eh,
boy? No more fighting and marching and
starving and freezing in the trenches of life.
Everything pleasant and Christmas weather
for the rest of the march.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, suh,&rdquo; answered Uncle Cesar. &ldquo;We
kin be jes&rsquo; as comfortable at Rosehill as ever
we was, suh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s eyes suddenly brightened,
and he raised his thin figure in the chair, and
his eyes saw into another world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear the music,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The band
plays very well to-day; it is playing a fine
march for the dress parade. Give me my
sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Cesar reached up and took the sword
from where it hung over the mantel, and put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>it gently in the Colonel&rsquo;s wasted hand. With
his feeble strength, the old man drew it half
out of its scabbard, and looked at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is bright,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There has never
been a stain upon it. Here comes the Commanding
Officer. Turn out the guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Cesar, who knew what was at hand,
answered reverently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ole Marse. The guard is turnin&rsquo;
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, raising the sword to the salute, the
gallant old Colonel heard the last order
to fall in, and met, face to face humbly, but
without fear and in perfect peace, the Great
Commander.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
